Part 2
Either A or B, or both, needs to be 1 for the OR gate to be 1, but if they were both 0 the OR gate will be 0. The NOT gate will flip the number(If it was 1 it will be 0 and vise versa).

| A | B |  OR(A, B) |  NOT(OR(A, B)) |
|---|---|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | 1 |     1     |        0       |
| 1 | 0 |     1     |        0       |
| 0 | 1 |     1     |        0       |
| 0 | 0 |     0     |        1       |
