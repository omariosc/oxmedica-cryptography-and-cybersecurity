# 7 Hacking and Cyber Attacks Assessment Brief

## Overview

Welcome to your seventh assessment! This mid-term test will assess your understanding of different types of cyber attacks and potential mitigations. This is an open-book assessment worth 20% of your grade and should take about 30 minutes to complete.

This is an open-book assessment, so feel free to refer to any resources you find helpful. It is worth 20% of your final grade.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Types of Cyber Attacks (15 minutes)

1. **Describe Different Attacks:**
   - Write a brief description of each of the following types of cyber attacks. Include examples where possible.
     - **Phishing:**
     - **Malware:**
     - **Ransomware:**
     - **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service):**
     - **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):**

<!-- ### Example Descriptions

- **Phishing:** A type of social engineering attack where attackers send fraudulent messages designed to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details. For example, an attacker might send an email that appears to be from a trusted source, asking the recipient to click a link and enter their login credentials.
- **Malware:** Malicious software designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems. Examples include viruses, worms, trojans, and spyware. For instance, a virus might infect a computer and spread to other devices via email attachments.
- **Ransomware:** A type of malware that encrypts a victim's files, making them inaccessible until a ransom is paid to the attacker. An example is the WannaCry ransomware attack that affected numerous organizations worldwide.
- **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service):** An attack that aims to overwhelm a website or online service with a flood of internet traffic, causing it to become slow or unavailable. Attackers often use botnets to carry out these attacks.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attack where the attacker secretly intercepts and relays communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other. For example, an attacker might intercept and alter messages between a user and a website. -->

### Part 2: Mitigations (15 minutes)

1. **Potential Mitigations:**
   - For each type of attack described in Part 1, suggest one or more potential mitigations. Explain how these mitigations can help prevent or reduce the impact of the attacks.

<!-- ### Example Mitigations

- **Phishing:** Implement email filtering solutions to detect and block phishing emails. Educate users about the risks of phishing and train them to recognize suspicious messages. Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security.
- **Malware:** Use antivirus and anti-malware software to detect and remove malicious software. Keep systems and software up to date with the latest security patches. Avoid downloading and installing software from untrusted sources.
- **Ransomware:** Regularly back up important data and store backups offline. Use robust security software to detect and block ransomware. Educate users about the risks of opening suspicious email attachments and links.
- **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service):** Implement DDoS protection services to detect and mitigate attack traffic. Use load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple servers. Ensure scalable bandwidth to handle sudden traffic spikes.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** Use encryption protocols such as HTTPS to secure communication channels. Implement VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) to protect data in transit. Educate users about the risks of using unsecured public Wi-Fi networks. -->


## Answers:
Part 1:
1. Phishing is when hackers trick people into giving away personal info, like passwords, by pretending to be someone trustworthy. This often happens through fake emails or messages.

Example: An email that looks like itâ€™s from your bank, asking you to enter your account info.

2. Malware is a harmful software designed to damage or take control of your computer. It includes viruses, worms, and trojans.

Example: A fake software update that installs a program letting hackers control your computer.

3. Ransomware is a type of malware that locks your files or computer and demands money to unlock it. It often spreads through fake emails.

Example: The WannaCry attack, which locked thousands of computers and demanded payment in Bitcoin to unlock them.

4. A DDoS attack floods a website or service with too much traffic, making it crash and unavailable to users. Hackers use many infected computers to do this.

Example: The Mirai botnet attack in 2016, which took down major websites by flooding them with traffic.

5. A Man-in-the-Middle attack is when hackers secretly intercept and alter communication between two people who think they are talking directly to each other. This can happen on insecure Wi-Fi networks.

Example: A hacker intercepting messages between an enemy country and its soldiers, therefore exposing their plans.

Part 2:

Phishing:
Mitigation: Use Email Filters and Awareness Training

Explanation: Email filters can detect and block phishing emails before they reach your inbox. Awareness training helps individuals recognize and avoid phishing attempts, reducing the likelihood of falling for these scams.


Malware:
Mitigation: Install and Update Antivirus Software

Explanation: Antivirus software can detect and remove malware before it harms your computer. Regular updates ensure the software can recognize the latest threats.


Ransomware:
Mitigation: Regular Backups and Avoid Clicking on Suspicious Links

Explanation: Regularly backing up your files means you can restore them if they get encrypted by ransomware. Being cautious about clicking on links or attachments in emails can prevent ransomware from getting onto your system in the first place.


DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service):
Mitigation: Use DDoS Protection Services

Explanation: DDoS protection services, such as Cloudflare or Akamai, can detect and filter out malicious traffic before it reaches your website, keeping it online during an attack.


Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):
Mitigation: Use Encryption and Secure Networks

Explanation: Encryption, like HTTPS for websites, ensures that communication between parties is secure and unreadable by attackers. Using secure, password-protected Wi-Fi networks reduces the risk of interception.
