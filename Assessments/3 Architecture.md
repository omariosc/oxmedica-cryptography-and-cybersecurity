# 3 Architecture of Computers Assessment Brief

## Overview

Welcome to your third assessment! This exercise is designed to deepen your understanding of computer components and basic logic gates. You will be asked to pick a computer component and explain its role, inputs, outputs, and interfaces. Additionally, you will solve a logic gate question and provide a complete truth table. This assessment should take about 30 minutes to complete.

This is an open-book assessment, so feel free to refer to any resources you find helpful. It is worth 10% of your final grade.

## Part 1: Computer Component

### Part 1 Instructions

1. **Choose a Component:**
   - Pick a component inside a computer (e.g., GPU, RAM, Hard Drive, Motherboard, Power Supply, etc.), excluding the CPU (as we will use it as an example).

2. **Describe the Component:**
   - Explain the role of the chosen component in the computer system.
   - Describe its inputs and outputs.
   - Identify what other components or systems it interfaces with.

### Example Component

**Component:** Central Processing Unit (CPU)

- **Role:** The CPU is the brain of the computer, responsible for executing instructions from programs.
- **Inputs:** Instructions from memory (RAM), data from storage devices.
- **Outputs:** Processed data sent back to memory, signals sent to other components for further actions.
- **Interfaces:** Interfaces with RAM, motherboard, storage devices (HDD/SSD), and peripheral devices through various buses (data, address, control).

## Part 2: Logic Gates and Truth Table

### Part 2 Instructions

1. **Logic Gate Question:**
   - Given the following logic gate circuit, describe what it does:
     - A circuit with two inputs (A or B) and an output (Q).
     - The circuit consists of an OR gate followed by a NOT gate.

2. **Truth Table:**
   - Create a truth table for the described logic gate circuit.
   - Include all possible input combinations and the corresponding output.

<!-- ### Example Logic Gate Circuit

**Logic Gate Circuit:** NOT(AND(A, B))

- **Description:** The circuit takes two inputs, A and B. The AND gate outputs true only if both A and B are true. The NOT gate then inverts this output.
  
**Truth Table:**

| A | B | AND(A, B) | NOT(AND(A, B)) |
|---|---|-----------|----------------|
| 0 | 0 |     0     |        1       |
| 0 | 1 |     0     |        1       |
| 1 | 0 |     0     |        1       |
| 1 | 1 |     1     |        0       | -->
