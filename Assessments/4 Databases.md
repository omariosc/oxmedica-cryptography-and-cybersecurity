## Overview

Welcome to your fourth assessment! This assessment is designed for you to execute SQL queries and perform a successful SQL injection. This assessment should take about 30 minutes to complete.

This is an open-book assessment, so feel free to refer to any resources you find helpful. It is worth 10% of your final grade. You can work in groups of 2, 3 or 4.

## Instructions

1. Create the Books, Members and Borrowing tables using Python and SQL.
2. Add a new book, a new member and a new borrowing with these two entities.
3. **Do not use any security practices**, and show how you can perform an SQL injection. Try to make it display all member data.
4. Now implement a fix to show how we can prevent SQL injections.

## Submission
