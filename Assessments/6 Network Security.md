# 6 Network Security Concepts Assessment Brief

Name: _NSR SDS_

## Overview

Welcome to your sixth assessment! This exercise is designed to introduce you to network security concepts, including how the internet works, the importance of security, and how security is implemented. This is an open-book assessment worth 15% of your grade and should take about 30 minutes to complete.

This is an open-book assessment, so feel free to refer to any resources you find helpful. It is worth 15% of your final grade.

## Instructions

### Part 1: How the Internet Works (10 minutes)

Write a brief description (150-200 words) of how the internet works. Include key concepts such as IP addresses, DNS, and data packets.

<!-- ### Example Answer

The internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate through a standardized set of protocols. Each device on the internet is assigned a unique IP address that allows it to be identified and located by other devices. When you enter a website address into your browser, a DNS (Domain Name System) server translates the human-readable address into an IP address. Data is then broken into smaller packets and sent over various routes across the network to its destination, where it is reassembled into the original message. -->

### Part 2: Importance of Network Security (10 minutes)

Explain why network security is crucial. Discuss the potential risks and consequences of weak security, including examples of common threats like malware, phishing, and DDoS attacks.

<!-- ### Example Explanation

Network security is crucial to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, theft, and damage. Weak security can lead to various risks, such as malware infections, phishing attacks, and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which can disrupt services and cause significant financial and reputational damage. For instance, a malware attack can compromise personal information, leading to identity theft, while a DDoS attack can shut down an organization's online services, resulting in lost revenue and customer trust. -->

### Part 3: Implementing Network Security (10 minutes)

Describe how network security can be implemented. Include at least three methods such as firewalls, encryption, and secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS).

<!-- ### Example Implementation

Network security can be implemented through various methods:

- **Firewalls:** Act as barriers between trusted and untrusted networks, monitoring and controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
- **Encryption:** Protects data by converting it into a code that can only be deciphered with a key, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential during transmission.
- **Secure Protocols:** Protocols like HTTPS ensure secure communication over the internet by encrypting data between the client and server, preventing interception and tampering. -->

## Submission

- Write your answers in a digital document.
- Include your name at the top of the document.
- Save the file with the name `"6 Network Security Assessment.md"` in the `"Solutions"` folder.

Have fun, and take this opportunity to understand the essential concepts of network security!
