Describe how network security can be implemented. Include at least three methods such as firewalls, encryption, and secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS).

<!-- ### Example Implementation

Network security can be implemented through various methods:

- **Firewalls:** Act as barriers between trusted and untrusted networks, monitoring and controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
- **Encryption:** Protects data by converting it into a code that can only be deciphered with a key, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential during transmission.
- **Secure Protocols:** Protocols like HTTPS ensure secure communication over the internet by encrypting data between the client and server, preventing interception and tampering. -->
