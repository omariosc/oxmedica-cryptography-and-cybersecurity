# 7 Hacking and Cyber Attacks Assessment Brief

## Overview

Welcome to your seventh assessment! This mid-term test will assess your understanding of different types of cyber attacks and potential mitigations. This is an open-book assessment worth 20% of your grade and should take about 30 minutes to complete.

This is an open-book assessment, so feel free to refer to any resources you find helpful. It is worth 20% of your final grade.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Types of Cyber Attacks (15 minutes)

1. **Describe Different Attacks:**
   - Write a brief description of each of the following types of cyber attacks. Include examples where possible.
     - **Phishing:**
     - **Malware:**
     - **Ransomware:**
     - **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service):**
     - **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):**

<!-- ### Example Descriptions

- **Phishing:** A type of social engineering attack where attackers send fraudulent messages designed to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details. For example, an attacker might send an email that appears to be from a trusted source, asking the recipient to click a link and enter their login credentials.
- **Malware:** Malicious software designed to damage, disrupt, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems. Examples include viruses, worms, trojans, and spyware. For instance, a virus might infect a computer and spread to other devices via email attachments.
- **Ransomware:** A type of malware that encrypts a victim's files, making them inaccessible until a ransom is paid to the attacker. An example is the WannaCry ransomware attack that affected numerous organizations worldwide.
- **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service):** An attack that aims to overwhelm a website or online service with a flood of internet traffic, causing it to become slow or unavailable. Attackers often use botnets to carry out these attacks.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attack where the attacker secretly intercepts and relays communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other. For example, an attacker might intercept and alter messages between a user and a website. -->

### Part 2: Mitigations (15 minutes)

1. **Potential Mitigations:**
   - For each type of attack described in Part 1, suggest one or more potential mitigations. Explain how these mitigations can help prevent or reduce the impact of the attacks.

<!-- ### Example Mitigations

- **Phishing:** Implement email filtering solutions to detect and block phishing emails. Educate users about the risks of phishing and train them to recognize suspicious messages. Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security.
- **Malware:** Use antivirus and anti-malware software to detect and remove malicious software. Keep systems and software up to date with the latest security patches. Avoid downloading and installing software from untrusted sources.
- **Ransomware:** Regularly back up important data and store backups offline. Use robust security software to detect and block ransomware. Educate users about the risks of opening suspicious email attachments and links.
- **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service):** Implement DDoS protection services to detect and mitigate attack traffic. Use load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple servers. Ensure scalable bandwidth to handle sudden traffic spikes.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** Use encryption protocols such as HTTPS to secure communication channels. Implement VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) to protect data in transit. Educate users about the risks of using unsecured public Wi-Fi networks. -->

## Submission

- Write your answers in a digital document.
- Include your name at the top of the document.
- Save the file with the name `"7 Hacking and Cyber Attacks Assessment.md"` in the `"Solutions"` folder.

Have fun, and take this opportunity to deepen your understanding of cyber attacks and their mitigations!
