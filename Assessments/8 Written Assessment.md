# 8 Final Written Assessment Brief

## Overview

Welcome to your eighth and final assessment! This assessment will cover all the major topics we have discussed previously, excluding hacking and cyber-attacks, which were addressed in the seventh assessment. The decision to move this written assessment to week 2 was due to the potential lack of time for marking.

This is an semi-open-book assessment, meaning you can refer to your notes and resources but not to the internet or other students. You will have 1 hour to complete this assessment. It is worth 20% of your final grade.

## Instructions

Answer the following questions to the best of your ability. Each question is designed to assess your understanding of key concepts related to cybersecurity, computer systems, and networking. Write your responses clearly and concisely, providing examples or explanations where appropriate.

1. **Cybersecurity Case Study:**
   - Explain the impact of a recent high-profile data breach on the affected company and its customers. What steps can organizations take to respond effectively to a data breach?

2. **Practical Python:**
   - Write a Python script that reads a text file and counts the number of occurrences of each word. Describe how your script processes the file and counts the words.

3. **Computer Components and Logic Gates:**
   - Explain the role of RAM in a computer system. What are its inputs and outputs, and how does it interact with the CPU and storage devices?

4. **Database Systems:**
   - Design an SQL schema for an online store with the following requirements:
     - Products have a unique ID, name, description, and price.

     - Customers have a unique ID, name, email, and address.
     - Orders have a unique ID, customer ID, order date, and total amount.
     - Each order can contain multiple products. Include primary keys, foreign keys, and relevant data types.

5. **Network Security Concepts:**
   - Describe the concept of a VPN (Virtual Private Network). How does it work, and what are its advantages and disadvantages in terms of network security?

6. **Cryptographic Techniques:**
   - Explain the concept of public key cryptography. Describe how it differs from symmetric key cryptography and provide an example of how it can be used to secure communication.

### Submission

- Write your answers in a digital document.
- Include your name at the top of the document.
- Save the file with the name `"8 Final Written Assessment.md"` in the `"Solutions"` folder.
- Write your answer for the Python script question using a code block in the document e.g., triple backticks for Python code (```).
- Write your answer for SQL schema design using a code block in the document e.g., triple backticks for SQL code (```).

```bat
```python
# Python code goes here
```

```bat
```sql
-- SQL code goes here
```

Good luck, and take this opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of the key concepts we have covered in this course!
