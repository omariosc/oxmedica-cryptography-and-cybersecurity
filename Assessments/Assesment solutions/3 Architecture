# 3 Architecture of Computers Assessment Brief

## Overview

Welcome to your third assessment! This exercise is designed to deepen your understanding of computer components and basic logic gates. You will be asked to pick a computer component and explain its role, inputs, outputs, and interfaces. Additionally, you will solve a logic gate question and provide a complete truth table. This assessment should take about 30 minutes to complete.

This is an open-book assessment, so feel free to refer to any resources you find helpful. It is worth 10% of your final grade.

## Part 1: Computer Component

### Part 1 Instructions

1. **Choose a Component:**
   - Pick a component inside a computer (e.g., GPU, RAM, Hard Drive, Motherboard, Power Supply, etc.), excluding the CPU (as we will use it as an example).

2. **Describe the Component:**
   - Explain the role of the chosen component in the computer system.
   - Describe its inputs and outputs.
   - Identify what other components or systems it interfaces with.

### Example Component

**Component:** Central Processing Unit (CPU)

- **Role:** The CPU is the brain of the computer, responsible for executing instructions from programs.
- **Inputs:** Instructions from memory (RAM), data from storage devices.
- **Outputs:** Processed data sent back to memory, signals sent to other components for further actions.
- **Interfaces:** Interfaces with RAM, motherboard, storage devices (HDD/SSD), and peripheral devices through various buses (data, address, control).

## Part 2: Logic Gates and Truth Table

### Part 2 Instructions

1. **Logic Gate Question:**
   - Given the following logic gate circuit, describe what it does:
     - A circuit with two inputs (A and B) and an output (Q).
     - The circuit consists of an AND gate followed by a NOT gate.

2. **Truth Table:**
   - Create a truth table for the described logic gate circuit.
   - Include all possible input combinations and the corresponding output.

<!-- ### Example Logic Gate Circuit

**Logic Gate Circuit:** NOT(AND(A, B))

- **Description:** The circuit takes two inputs, A AND B. The AND gate outputs true only if both A and B are true. The NOT gate then inverts this output.
  
**Truth Table:**

| A | B | AND(A, B) | NOT(AND(A, B)) |
|---|---|-----------|----------------|
| 0 | 0 |     0     |        1       |
| 0 | 1 |     0     |        1       |
| 1 | 0 |     0     |        1       |
| 1 | 1 |     1     |        0       | -->

## Submission

- Write your answers in a digital document.
- Include your name at the top of the document.
- Save the file with the name `"3 Architecture Assessment.md"` in the `"Solutions"` folder.

Have fun, and take this opportunity to explore the fascinating world of computer components and logic gates!

ANSWERS:

Q1:

The motherboard is the central circuit board in a computer that connects and coordinates all essential components. It houses the CPU socket for the processor,
memory slots for RAM, and expansion slots for additional cards like graphics and network adapters. It manages power distribution from the PSU and facilitates data
transfer between the CPU, memory, storage devices, and peripherals like keyboards and monitors. In essence, it's the critical hub that enables all parts of the computer
to work together seamlessly.



Motherboards interface directly with essential computer components like the CPU, RAM, storage devices (like hard drives and SSDs), expansion cards
(such as graphics and network cards), and various peripherals (like keyboards, mice, monitors, and printers).
They manage power distribution, data transfer, and ensure seamless communication between all connected parts of the computer system.



Q2: 




Truth Table:**

| A | B | or(A, B) | NOT(or(A, B)) |
|---|---|-----------|----------------|
| 0 | 0 |     0     |        1       |
| 0 | 1 |     1     |        0       |
| 1 | 0 |     1     |        0       |
| 1 | 1 |     1     |        0       | -->
