# 8 Final Written Assessment Brief

## Overview

Welcome to your eighth and final assessment! This assessment will cover all the major topics we have discussed previously, excluding hacking and cyber-attacks, which were addressed in the seventh assessment. The decision to move this written assessment to week 2 was due to the potential lack of time for marking.

This is an semi-open-book assessment, meaning you can refer to your notes and resources but not to the internet or other students. You will have 1 hour to complete this assessment. It is worth 20% of your final grade.

## Instructions

Answer the following questions to the best of your ability. Each question is designed to assess your understanding of key concepts related to cybersecurity, computer systems, and networking. Write your responses clearly and concisely, providing examples or explanations where appropriate.

1. **Cybersecurity Case Study:**
   - Explain the impact of a recent high-profile data breach on the affected company and its customers. What steps can organizations take to respond effectively to a data breach?

2. **Practical Python:**
   - Write a Python script that reads a text file and counts the number of occurrences of each word. Describe how your script processes the file and counts the words.

3. **Computer Components and Logic Gates:**
   - Explain the role of RAM in a computer system. What are its inputs and outputs, and how does it interact with the CPU and storage devices?

4. **Database Systems:**
   - Design an SQL schema for an online store with the following requirements:
     - Products have a unique ID, name, description, and price.
     - Customers have a unique ID, name, email, and address.
     - Orders have a unique ID, customer ID, order date, and total amount.
     - Each order can contain multiple products. Include primary keys, foreign keys, and relevant data types.

5. **Network Security Concepts:**
   - Describe the concept of a VPN (Virtual Private Network). How does it work, and what are its advantages and disadvantages in terms of network security?

6. **Cryptographic Techniques:**
   - Explain the concept of public key cryptography. Describe how it differs from symmetric key cryptography and provide an example of how it can be used to secure communication.

### Submission

- Write your answers in a digital document.
- Include your name at the top of the document.
- Save the file with the name `"8 Final Written Assessment.md"` in the `"Solutions"` folder.
- Write your answer for the Python script question using a code block in the document e.g., triple backticks for Python code (```).
- Write your answer for SQL schema design using a code block in the document e.g., triple backticks for SQL code (```).

```bat
```python
# Python code goes here
```

```bat
```sql
-- SQL code goes here
```

Good luck, and take this opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of the key concepts we have covered in this course!



1. A high-profile data breach can have significant impacts on both the affected company and its customers, affecting trust, finances, and reputation.

   impact on customers:

   1. Identity Theft: Stolen data could be used for identity theft, causing financial and emotional distress.

   2. Loss of Privacy: Customers may feel violated and lose confidence in the companyâ€™s ability to protect their personal information.

   3. Inconvenience: Dealing with canceled credit cards, monitoring accounts for fraud, and updating personal information can be inconvenient and time-consuming.


   impact on company: 

   1. Reputation Damage: A breach can severely damage the company's reputation, leading to loss of trust among customers, investors, and partners.

   2. Financial Losses: Costs can escalate due to legal fees, regulatory fines, customer compensation, and cybersecurity improvements.

   3. Operational Disruption: Managing the fallout can divert resources and focus away from core business activities.



   Responding to a data breach: 

   Immediate Actions:

   1. Containment: Quickly isolate and contain the breach to prevent further damage.

   2. Investigation: Conduct a thorough investigation to understand the breach's scope and cause.


   Communication:

      Internal: Notify key stakeholders within the company to coordinate response efforts.

      External: Notify affected individuals, customers, and regulatory bodies as required, providing transparent communication about the breach and actions being taken.


   Legal and Compliance:

       Ensure compliance with legal and regulatory obligations regarding data breach notification and mitigation.



    

2. def count_words(filename):
    word_count = {}

    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        # Read each line in the file
        for line in file:
            # Split the line into words
            words = line.split()
            for word in words:
                # Remove punctuation (optional)
                word = word.strip(",.?!'-\"").lower()
                # Count the word in the dictionary
                if word:
                    if word in word_count:
                        word_count[word] += 1
                    else:
                        word_count[word] = 1

    return word_count

def main():
    filename = 'sample_text.txt'  # Replace with your text file
    word_count = count_words(filename)

    # Print the word counts
    for word, count in word_count.items():
        print(f'{word}: {count}')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

















3. RAM provides the shorter-term memory the CPU needs to open files and move data around as it responds to the tasks given to it by your apps. Both RAM and the CPU work synchronously and complementarily to ensure that your computer's performance fits your needs and you have a good experience when using your device.

5. VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a technology that:

Encrypts your internet connection, ensuring data security, Masks your IP address, enhancing anonymity, Allows secure access to restricted content and private networks, Protects against public Wi-Fi threats.

Advantages:

1. Encrypts data, protecting sensitive information.
2. Enhances privacy and anonymity online.
3. Enables secure remote access and bypasses geo-blocks.


Disadvantages:

1. Can slow down connection speeds.
2. Requires trust in the VPN provider.
3. Potential for configuration errors or leaks.



6. Public Key Cryptography uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. It differs from symmetric cryptography where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.

Example: Omar shares his public key with Khaled. Khaled uses it to encrypt a message before sending it to Omar. Only Omar can decrypt the message using his private key, ensuring secure communication.
