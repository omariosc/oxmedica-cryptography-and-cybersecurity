    "# 3 Architecture of Computers Assessment Brief\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to your third assessment! This exercise is designed to deepen your understanding of computer components and basic logic gates. You will be asked to pick a computer component and explain its role, inputs, outputs, and interfaces. Additionally, you will solve a logic gate question and provide a complete truth table. This assessment should take about 30 minutes to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an open-book assessment, so feel free to refer to any resources you find helpful. It is worth 10% of your final grade.\n",

    "## Part 1: Computer Component\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1 Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Choose a Component:**\n",
    "   - Pick a component inside a computer (e.g., GPU, RAM, Hard Drive, Motherboard, Power Supply, etc.), excluding the CPU (as we will use it as an example):Power Supply\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Describe the Component:**\n",
    "   - Explain the role of the chosen component in the computer system: its the main power supplier to all the other components in the pc.\n",
    "   - Describe its inputs and outputs:It uses cablesm that mainly connect to the mother board to spread power throughout the pc.\n",
    "   - Identify what other components or systems it interfaces with.:it also helps provide the power to external out puts such as speakers,keyboards, and screens.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Component\n",
    "\n",
    "**Component:** Central Processing Unit (CPU)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Role:** The CPU is the brain of the computer, responsible for executing instructions from programs.\n",
    "- **Inputs:** Instructions from memory (RAM), data from storage devices.\n",
    "- **Outputs:** Processed data sent back to memory, signals sent to other components for further actions.\n",
    "- **Interfaces:** Interfaces with RAM, motherboard, storage devices (HDD/SSD), and peripheral devices through various buses (data, address, control).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: Logic Gates and Truth Table\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2 Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Logic Gate Question:**\n",
    "   - Given the following logic gate circuit, describe what it does:\n",
    "     - A circuit with two inputs (A and B) and an output (Q).\n",
    "     - The circuit consists of an AND gate followed by a NOT gate.\n",
    "     -Answer: Given two inputs A, and B Since it is first encountered by an and gate they must be both positive so that it can give a positive product. Once the product is produced it will encounter an not gate which turns positive into negative and vice versa which then gives us the answer to the logic gate. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Truth Table:**\n",
    "   - Create a truth table for the described logic gate circuit.\n",
    "   - Include all possible input combinations and the corresponding output.\n",
    "\n",
    "| A | B | OR(A, B)  | NOT(OR(A, B))  | Output |\n",
    "|---|---|-----------|----------------|--------|\n",
    "| 0 | 0 |     0     |        1       |    1   |\n",
    "| 0 | 1 |     1     |        0       |    0   |\n",
    "| 1 | 0 |     1     |        0       |    0   |\n",
    "| 1 | 1 |     1     |        0       |    0   |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write your answers in a digital document.\n",
    "- Include your name at the top of the document.\n",
    "- Save the file with the name `\"3 Architecture Assessment.md\"` in the `\"Solutions\"` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have fun, and take this opportunity to explore the fascinating world of computer components and logic gates!\n"
