    "# 5 Cryptographic Techniques Assessment Brief\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to your fifth assessment! This exercise is designed to introduce you to the fundamental concepts of cryptographic techniques through a practical activity. You will work in pairs to research, encrypt, and decrypt a message. This assessment should take about one hour to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an open-book assessment, so feel free to refer to any resources you find helpful. It is worth 15% of your final grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1: Research (15 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Form Pairs:**\n",
    "   - Choose a partner to work with for this activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Research:**\n",
    "   - Spend time researching various cryptographic techniques such as Caesar Cipher, Substitution Cipher, Transposition Cipher, and VigenÃ¨re Cipher. The one you choose should be more complex than the Caesar Cipher.\n",
    "   - Discuss with your partner and choose one cryptographic technique to use for this activity.\n",
    "   - Take notes on how your chosen technique works, including examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2: Encrypt a Message (15 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Select a Message:**\n",
    "   - Decide on a short message (one or two sentences) to encrypt.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Encrypt:**\n",
    "   - Use the chosen cryptographic technique to encrypt the message.\n",
    "   - Write down the encrypted message clearly.\n",
    "   - Document the steps you took to encrypt the message, including any keys or shifts used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 3: Decrypt a Message (15 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exchange Messages:**\n",
    "   - Exchange your encrypted message with another pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Decrypt:**\n",
    "   - Using the same cryptographic technique, decrypt the message you received from the other pair.\n",
    "   - Write down the decrypted message clearly.\n",
    "   - Document the steps you took to decrypt the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 4: Analysis and Discussion (15 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Analyze:**\n",
    "   - Compare the decrypted message with the original message.\n",
    "   - Discuss with your partner if there were any discrepancies and why they might have occurred.\n",
    "   - Reflect on the effectiveness of the cryptographic technique you used.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Discussion Questions:**\n",
    "   - What are the strengths and weaknesses of the cryptographic technique you used?\n",
    "   - How easy or difficult was it to encrypt and decrypt the messages?\n",
    "   - In what real-world scenarios could this cryptographic technique be applied?\n",
    "   - How might more advanced cryptographic techniques improve security?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chosen Technique:** Caesar Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "**Original Message:** \"Hello World\"\n",
    "**Encryption Key:** 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encrypted Message:** \"Khoor Zruog\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decrypted Message:** \"Hello World\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps Taken:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encryption: Shift each letter by 3 positions forward in the alphabet.\n",
    "- Decryption: Shift each letter by 3 positions backward in the alphabet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write your encrypted and decrypted messages in a digital document.\n",
    "- Include the names of both partners at the top of the document.\n",
    "- Document the steps taken for encryption and decryption, as well as your analysis and discussion points.\n",
    "- Save the file with the name `\"5 Cryptographic Techniques Assessment.md\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enjoy learning and exploring the exciting world of cryptography!\n"
