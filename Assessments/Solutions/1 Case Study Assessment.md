## Answers

1.A data breach in my own words is basically intruders gaining acces to your vault of treasures and its been made public to millions of people, this can affect the company by ruining its reputation and the affected customers wont be returning to them. This also affects each person by leaking their personal information to other hackers which makes them more exposed to phishing attacks as well as money scams.

2.Phishing emails are in the most basic way, email with a disguise on them. They are sent to different kinds of people especially company employees and once clicked on can breach that persons device and go on to breach the whole network of the company.

3.They should have improved their antivirus and detection system as well as gotten the latest network security software however the most important thing that could have prevented all of this from happening is regular training for the employees to help them defrentiate between emails and help them notice phishing email specifically.

4.The customers information is now with the hackers and the customers are more exposed to viruses and hackers. This affects the comapny in a huge way by ruing their reputation which is more ikely to make their sales go down and they most definitely will try to fix this issue and implement new rules and regultion in the company.

5.The first thing that should be done is regular employee training that takes place every four months or so. The company has to improve its security measures by upgrading their detection system and have some measures ready for when and if another incident like this happens again.
