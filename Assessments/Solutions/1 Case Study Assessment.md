## Answers

1. Data Breach is when some data gets attacked / hacked by a hacker or a group of hackers. Some companies and customers have important informations (data) about them. Thts why it is a really important to secure them. It is significant for both company and its customers because it may effect their whole life, and can switch it from a lovley life to becoming poor. 

2. Phishing email is a fack email account that sends you some emails to access the data from a company or a customer. It may get hard to know if the guy you are talking to is the same guy or just random phisher trying to get access. Once they get permission or access to some data, they will steal it easily. So this simple idea / way could lead to a whole company's money or data being stolen.

3. There are multipule ways to prevent hackers from stealng or breaching datas. First one is trying to get away as possibale from phishers by asking them to give some evidence that they are the same person and not just a random hacker. Second is trying to make some secure walls behind your data. Example if you didn't understand, Making like some folders inside folders that can make the hacker / data breacher annoyed and angry. Or maybe getting different internets IP's to prevent hacks and stuff. 

4. The customers may lose their data and money, this could lead them to being poor, or having so much problems that is hard to get throw. It can effevt companies and business operations to make them poor, or lose their data.

5. Review emails daily, or maybe hourly, changing the internet IP or password every time a week, Move some important datas from a foulder to another foulder. Employees should know who they are talking to in emails, numbers, or communication apps to prevent data breach and hackers from accessing datas. And they should not connect all of their devices to the same internet, or maybe try to not give the passwords to different people unless if you really know them.
