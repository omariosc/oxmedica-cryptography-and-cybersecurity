## Case Study: The Data Breach at Acme Corp

### Background

Acme Corp, a large retail company, experienced a significant data breach last year. Hackers were able to infiltrate the company’s network and steal sensitive information, including customer names, addresses, credit card numbers, and purchase histories. The breach went undetected for several months, and by the time it was discovered, the personal information of millions of customers had been compromised.

### Incident Details

- **Date of Breach:** January 2023
- **Detection Date:** June 2023
- **Data Compromised:** Names, addresses, credit card numbers, purchase histories
- **Number of Affected Customers:** 5 million

### Investigation Findings

- The hackers gained access through a phishing email sent to an employee.
- The company’s network had outdated security software.
- There was a lack of regular security audits and employee training on cybersecurity practices.

## Questions

1. **Understanding the Breach**: What is a data breach, and why is it significant for both the company and its customers?

2. **Methods of Attack**: What is a phishing email, and how can it lead to a data breach?

3. **Security Measures**: What are some basic cybersecurity practices that Acme Corp could have implemented to prevent this breach?

4. **Impact Assessment**: What are the potential consequences of a data breach for the customers whose information was stolen? How might this breach affect Acme Corp’s reputation and business operations?

5. **Preventative Actions**: What steps can companies take to detect and respond to data breaches more quickly? How important is employee training in preventing cybersecurity incidents?

## Answers

1. A Data Breach is when bad actors and hackers get access to sensitive information of a company's customers. This information can include names, age, addresses, credit card information, usernames, passwords, and a lot of other information that a company stores.

2. Phishing emails are malicious emails that usually masquerade as real companies or systems, and link to a malicious webpage with the intention of stealing the victim's account.

3. They should have had regular security audits, and updated their security software and network very often. They also should have trained the employees on cybersecurity practices.

4. For the customers, this information is probably publicly available now, and can be tampered with and used. For the company, a data breach is a catastrophic event which will deter all current and future customers away from the company. The company's reputation is now diminished, and unless they're a very popular corporation that dominates the market, they will likely close down.

5. If companies perform regular security audits and set up a dedicated Incident Response team, then they would detect and respond to data breaches much faster than Acme Corp did. Employee training for these types of incidents would be a very beneficial improvement, and would probably not be very costly for an Enterprise.
