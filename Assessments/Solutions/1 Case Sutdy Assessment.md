## Answers

1. A data breach is an unauthorized party gaining access to a specific classified network through exploiting security flaws or deceiting humans, a data breach can compromise a lot of sensitive information related to the user, and so for the sake of their reputation and to avoid legal prosecution companies are required to employ cybersecurity to defend their systems of network and data centers.

2. A phising email is a type of social engineering that appears to be legitimate but has malicious files (such as trojans) that breach the reciepnts device and access their networks without their knowledge, a common phising technique is to illegitamtely copy a specific domain name and to put a non-ASCII character between the spaces so when its viewed by another party it appears normal.

3. Acme Corp unfortunately did not employ regular and consistent cybersecurity practices for their employees, this in turn compromised the whole company's network simply because an employee did not practice basic cybersecurity practices.
Acme Corp also did not actively update their networks' security software and apply the recent cybersecurity anti-penetration practices.

4. Generally any company that has faced a serious data breach see less users signing up into their data centers because they are viewd as insecure, additonally, customers who have had their private information leaked in a data breach can potentailly puruse legal prosecution towards Acme Corp.

5. Companies generally offer prizes and rewards for white hat hackers (such as in a hackathon) to regularly eliminate their network's security flaws and employ the newest cybersecurity anti-penetration practices, in addition, companies with good security for their networks generally monitor every activity that has interacted with their network, this is to identify any suspicious interactions that might indiciate a possibile intrusion and to eliminate the intruder before they gain access to senstiive information.
Consistent cybersecurity training for employees also lowers the possibility of a phising email, this is because employees are usually more wary when they are taught the basic indications of a possible phising email.
