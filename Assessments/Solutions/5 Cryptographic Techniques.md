Musaed Alhalwan

### Part 2
1. Message is: I love shawerma

**Encrypting**
Vigenere Cipher
U fgvi vtuoevpm
My key was Musaed as well.

### Part 3

**U fgvi vtuoevpm decrypted using the key Musaed comes with the message "I love shawerma"**
**Musaed**

***Vigen√®re Cipher***

KEY: Musaed

### Encryption
Plaintext: I love shawerma
Keyword: Musaed
Ciphertext: U fgvi vtuoevpm



### Part 4
Yokaig (Ciphertext) - Musaed (Original Text)
No obstacles were faced during encryption neither decryption
It's an efficent cryptographic technique however if the key is exposed its in danger


2. 
Strenghts:
Easy encryption
Easy decryption
Difficult to decrypt without the key


Weaknesses:
compromised if the key is exposed.
The key can be easily leaked

2. It was pretty easy to encrypt the message as well as encrypt it however this compromises its security as well.

3. It can be used to encrypt between text messages

4. It will be more difficult to decrypt therefore unauthorized parties would have a more difficult time to hack
