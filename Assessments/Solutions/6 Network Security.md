QUESTION 1:Write a brief description (150-200 words) of how the internet works. Include key concepts such as IP addresses, DNS, and data packets.

ANSWER : It serves as a platform through which millions of devices spread all over the world can be connected through exchanging information and communication over a set of standard protocols. At the core of the data transfer by the Internet are the basic principles of how information should be exchanged in packets. Every Internet connected device, including computers and smart phones, shares a unique IP address for identification purposes. Thus, when the user opens the website with the help of the text domain name—in this case, www.example.com—then, with the DNS service, it translates the name into an IP address so the website's server can be found by the browser.

Having settled the IP address, the browser sends a request to the server; from the data being requested, it forms the packets. Those packets include information and IP addresses that are the destinations. They travel on the Internet, independently of each other, toward the destination server until they get there, passing through routers and switches through an indeterminate number of possible paths. Reaching the server, the packets re-assemble again, and the called data—also put in packets but now addressed to the user's terminal—are sent back to the user's access terminal. That is the principle the Internet works on, making the efficient data transmission all over the world through this global network.


QUESTION 2: Explain why network security is crucial. Discuss the potential risks and consequences of weak security, including examples of common threats like malware, phishing, and DDoS attacks.

ANSWER: Network security is therefore an indispensable requirement for the protection of data, systems, and services against a myriad of threats. Weak security opens up weak points to bloom into dreadful consequences.

Malware, including viruses and ransomware, encrypt data, therefore involving loss of operations and holding your data for ransom in exchange for payment. Phishing activities dupe users into divulging sensitive information, which hackers exploit to steal their identity or gain unauthorized access.

DDoS attacks overwhelm traffic, leading to downtime and thus caused services to be disrupted, thereby impacting reputation. Illegal accesses to data can result in data theft, regulatory penalties, and erosion of customer confidence.

To that end, proper firewall protection, good encryption, and robust authentication will be effective countermeasures that enable the blocking of these modes of attack. They ensure that a network remains hardy against financial losses, operational disruption, and reputational damage.



QUESTION 3: Describe how network security can be implemented. Include at least three methods such as firewalls, encryption, and secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS).


Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS): These monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and can respond to threats in real-time, helping to prevent attacks.

Virtual Private Networks (VPNs): VPNs create secure, encrypted connections over public networks, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of data during transmission between remote users and corporate networks.

Multi-factor Authentication (MFA): MFA requires users to provide multiple forms of verification to access systems or networks, reducing the risk of unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised.
