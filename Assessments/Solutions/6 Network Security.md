### Part 1

The internet which stands for 'Interconnected Network' is a network compromised of millions of computers that communicate to each other through a specific set of protocols, how it works exactly is that a bunch of devices are connected to a router (which is basically their IP) and so these routers communicate and send requests based on the device connected to the router, on the other side, there are millions upon millions of devices and routers that exchange information between each other. Each device can have a DNS (Domain Name System) which basically translates their IP addresses to a human-readable format for the client to read. The way these devices in the internet communicate is through packets containing specific information that travel and take various routes until it reaches its device destination, where it is reassembled and translated into a human-readable format for the client to view the original intended message.


### Part 2

Network Security especially in this age is so crucial that governments around the world are investing millions upon millions to simply protect their data from malicious individuals, we have become so reliant on the internet we have so many sensitive information, such as personal banking information, home addresses, medical records, if someone were to be able to hack a system and gain access to these sensitive information they would be able to do a multitude of things.

Not to mention the rising popularity of IoT (Internet of Things) which is basically integrating home appliances and basic other necessities into the network, if a malicious hacker were to be able to intrude and gain access to the network they would be able to infiltrate and destroy things.

Some examples of common hacker attacks that can be easily mitigated and prevented
1- DDOS Attack
A DDoS Attack which stands for (Distributed Denial of Service) which basically means overwhelming a specific device with tons of packets (information) to the point it crashes and malfunctions, this type of attack once it occurs is very difficult to mitigate so most preventive measures must be made beforehand.

2- Phising
Phising is a type of Social Engineering which doesn't necessarily require actual programming or scripting, although it can include other types of attacks such as viruses and malware in combination.
Phising is usually made as an attempt to appear legitimate usually to an employee in a compan



### Part 3

We can implement various techniques and protocols to protect our network, the most notable would be:

1- Secure Protocols
When hosting a website, we must always use Https to ensure secure communication between the server side and the client side, this prevents malicious individuals from using MITM Attack (Man in the Middle Attack)

2- Secure Encryption
All data that is stored inside a server must be encrypted that can only be decrypted using a key that only few individuals know about, this is to prevent hackers who already have access to a network from gaining information about sensitive informationl


3- Firewalls
Firewalls can act as a sort of barrier between trusted networks, it monitors and controls incoming and outgoing packets and traffic based on already existing guidelines
