# 6 Network Security Assessment

Name: _NSR SDS_

> - Write a brief description (150-200 words) of how the internet works. Include key concepts such as IP addresses, DNS, and data packets.

### Description (1st)


The internet is a huge network of computers all connected together. Each computer has a special number called an **IP address** that lets it talk to others. When you type in a website name, like "www.example.com," your computer asks ***DNS*** servers to find the right IP address. These DNS servers have huge lists of IP addresses, and it combs through those to find the right one.

Once your computer knows the IP address, it sends out these chunks of data called **__packets__**. These packets travel through the internet, hopping from one computer to another until they reach their destination. Routers help them find the best path.

At the other end, the packets are put back together, and you see the website or information you wanted. All this happens super fast, so you can access a huge amount of stuff online and connect with people anywhere.

> - Explain why network security is crucial. Discuss the potential risks and consequences of weak security, including examples of common threats like malware, phishing, and DDoS attacks.

### Description (2nd)


**Network security** is really important because it keeps our connected world safe. When networks aren't secure, bad things can happen. For example, if someone gets into a network, they can steal personal information like passwords or credit card numbers. This is called a data breach, and it can lead to identity theft or financial loss for people and businesses.

There are different ways bad actors (black hat hackers) try to break into networks. One common way is through **malware**, which is like a digital virus that can infect computers and spread. Another trick is **phishing**, where scammers send fake emails pretending to be from trusted companies to trick people into giving away their info.

There's also something called a **DDoS attack**, where a black hat hacker floods a network with so much traffic that it can't handle it all. This can crash websites or make services unavailable for everyone.

When networks have weak security, it's like leaving the front door open for cybercriminals. It's an ongoing war between security experts and cybercriminals, and the biggest reason systems get breached is human error. That's why we must make sure everybody understands how important network security in general is.

> - Describe how network security can be implemented. Include at least three methods such as firewalls, encryption, and secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS).

### Description (3rd)


One way to implement network security is with firewalls, which act like security guards for your network. They watch incoming and outgoing traffic and decide who gets in and who doesn't. It acts as the **gatekeeper** for your computer traffic.

Another important method is encryption. This scrambles data into a secret code so that only authorized people can read it. Some good examples of this are **AES-256**, **Blowfish** and **Triple DES**

Using secure protocols, like HTTPS, is also crucial. These protocols create a safe way for information to travel between your device and a website. You can tell if a website is using HTTPS because it has a little padlock icon in the address bar. It's like having a private conversation where only you and the other person can understand each other.

These methods work together to create layers of protection for networks. By using firewalls, encryption, and secure protocols, we can help keep our information safe and prevent cyberattacks.
