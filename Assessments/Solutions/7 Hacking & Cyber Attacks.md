Types of Cyberattacks

1.
**Phising:** A social engineering type of attack intended to appear non-malicious to individuals, it can contain malware or a trojan in combination.
**Malware:** It's a malicious type of software that causes damage to the system.
**Ransomware:** A malicious type of program that once is executed locks the user out of all their files and demands a monetary gain.
**DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service):** A type of attack that overwhelms the server with needless packets to cause it to malfunction or shut down,
**Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** A type of interception that is made between two already exisiting connections inside a network to spy or to steal or to modify information going through the tunnel of connection, this type of attack is common in public networks.

### Part 2

Mitigations

**Phising:** Automatic email filtering systems, training employees on the risks of phising and how to respond to an actual attempt of phising.
**Malware:** Using an antivirus software to upkeep a consistent watch on any possible malicious software, updating the system to get up to date with the recent security patches.
**Ransomware:** Maintaining a consistent and regular schedule on backing up important information, using an anti-malware software to detect and remove such malicious software.
**DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service):** Rate limiting incoming packets, blocking specific IP addresses that transmit huge amounts of packets, distributing such packets across different servers to lessen the load on the main server.
**Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** Using security protocols that ensure secure and encrypted transmission between servers such as HTTPS, implementing VPNs to add another layer of secruity, avoiding public Wi-Fi networks.
