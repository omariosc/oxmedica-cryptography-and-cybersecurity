1. **Describe Different Attacks:**
   - Write a brief description of each of the following types of cyber attacks. Include examples where possible.


### - **Phishing:** 
Phishing is when a bad actor uses social engineering and sends fake messages or emails that contain malicious links.
### - **Malware:** 
Software designed by hackers in order to steal data, destroy computers or any other malicious action.
### - **Ransomware:** 
This type of malware encrypts all of your files and demands payment, usually in the form of cryptocurrency for anonymity, to get access to your files.
### - **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service):** 
This type of attack is when a server is overloaded with requests. Usually this is preventable, but some vulnerabilities like open memcache servers can cause spoofed requests to get processed and lead to a DDos attack.
### - **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** 
MitM is when data is intercepted by a "Man-in-the-Middle" of the connection. Usually, data is encrypted, so they wouldn't be able to read it even when it's transit, but some vulnerabilities can make this possible.
