### Part 1: Types of Cyber Attacks (15 minutes)

1. **Describe Different Attacks:**
   - Write a brief description of each of the following types of cyber attacks. Include examples where possible.


 Phishing:

Fraudulent emails or messages trick recipients into divulging sensitive information.
Example: Fake bank emails asking for account updates via malicious links.

Malware:

Malicious software designed to damage computers or steal data.
Example: Trojans that steal information after pretending to be legitimate programs.

Ransomware:

Encrypts files or locks users out of systems, demanding payment to restore access.
Example: WannaCry ransomware encrypted files globally in 2017, demanding Bitcoin.

DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service):

Overwhelms a target with traffic, making it inaccessible to legitimate users.
Example: Using a botnet to flood a website with requests until it crashes.

Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):

Intercepts communication to eavesdrop or manipulate information.
Example: Capturing Wi-Fi transmissions to steal login credentials or alter messages.



### Part 2: Mitigations (15 minutes)

1. **Potential Mitigations:**
   - For each type of attack described in Part 1, suggest one or more potential mitigations. Explain how these mitigations can help prevent or reduce the impact of the attacks.


 Phishing:

Email Filtering and Training: Use email filters to block phishing emails and conduct regular training to educate users about identifying and avoiding them.

Malware:

Antivirus Software and Patch Management: Install and update antivirus software regularly, and maintain up-to-date security patches to prevent malware infections.

Ransomware:

Backup and Disaster Recovery: Regularly back up data and store backups securely offline to mitigate the impact of ransomware attacks. Implement network segmentation to contain infections.

DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service):

Traffic Monitoring and DDoS Mitigation Services: Monitor network traffic for anomalies and employ DDoS mitigation services to filter malicious traffic and maintain service availability.

Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):

Encryption and Secure Connections: Use strong encryption (e.g., TLS) for data transmission and implement secure connections such as VPNs to prevent MitM attacks.
