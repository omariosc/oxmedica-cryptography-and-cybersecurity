Symmetric Encryption:
Symmetric encryption uses a single key for both encryption and decryption of data. The same key is used by both the sender and the receiver to encrypt and decrypt messages. The key must be kept secret and known only to the communicating parties. Examples of symmetric encryption algorithms include AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), DES (Data Encryption Standard), and 3DES (Triple DES).

Asymmetric Encryption:
Asymmetric encryption uses a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is widely distributed and is used by anyone who wants to send an encrypted message to the owner of the public key. The private key is kept secret and is used for decrypting messages that have been encrypted with the corresponding public key. Asymmetric encryption enables secure communication between parties who have no prior knowledge of each other. Examples of asymmetric encryption algorithms include RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm), and ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography).

Hashing Algorithms:
Hashing algorithms are used to transform input data (such as a message or a file) into a fixed-size string of bytes, which typically represents a unique fingerprint of the original data. The output of a hashing algorithm is called a hash value, hash code, or digest. Hashing is a one-way process, meaning you cannot reverse-engineer the original input data from the hash value (given a good hashing algorithm). Hash functions are commonly used in digital signatures, password storage, and data integrity checks. Examples of hashing algorithms include SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit), MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5), and bcrypt.
