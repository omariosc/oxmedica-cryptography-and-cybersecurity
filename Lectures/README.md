3. **Critical Cybersecurity Case Studies (30 mins)**
    - This is to provide additional motivation and to refer back to it as we teach future core topics. This way, students will clearly understand that the theory they are learning is entirely applicable in practice and potentially give some excitement at the beginning (I mean, how does the US Pentagon get hacked?…). As a side point, the rest of this lecture can be used to discuss some bases around security, hackers and threats and perhaps authentication (including entropy, physical tokens, two-factor authentication (2FA) and biometrics).

        - Internet Infrastructure
        - Network Architecture

10. **Network Security Concepts Part 1 (45 mins)**
    - Discuss TCP/IP networking threats and architecture, network defences (TLS and firewalls) and packet filtering.
    - Topics:
        - TCP/IP Networking Threats
        - Network Architecture
        - Network Defences
        - Packet Filtering

11. **Network Security Concepts Part 2 (30 mins)**
    - Continue discussing network security concepts. Focus on defence against man-in-the-middle attacks, firewalls and domain name systems (DNS).
    - Topics:
        - 

12. **Cybersecurity Leglisation and Regulation (30 mins)**
    - Based on all the information we have covered so far, we should discuss legislation and regulations (including those in Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the EU).
    - Topics:
        - Legislation and Regulation
        - Saudi Arabia
        - United Kingdom
        - United States
        - European Union

13. **Cyber Attacks (30 mins)**
    - Many core topics revolve around attacks. We would combine this all under Hacking and Cyber Attacks, initially beginning with an introduction, followed by analysing case studies for Brute Force Attacks and DDoS Attacks.
    - Topics:
        - Hacking and Cyber Attacks
        - Brute Force Attacks
        - DDoS Attacks

14. **Buffer Overflows (30 mins)**
    - This lecture will cover Buffer Overflows and issues faced with memory. There will be a short reminder about SQL injections.
    - Topics:
        - Buffer Overflows
        - Memory Issues
        - SQL Injections

15. **Malware and Viruses (30 mins)**
    - This is similar to the previous area but involves much more detail. Thus, I suggest more time dedicated to this. Malware discussed would be logic bombs, backdoors, viruses, supply chain tracks, Trojan horses and worms.
    - Topics:
        - Malware and Viruses
        - Logic Bombs
        - Backdoors
        - Viruses
        - Supply Chain Attacks
        - Trojan Horses
        - Worms

16. **Threat-Vectors and Threat Agents (30 mins)**
    - Vector-based threats involve Cross-Site Scripting, Insider Threats, and Social Engineering. Agent-based threats involve Hacktivists, Script Kiddies, Cyber Crime Gangs, and Black-and-White Hat Hackers.

        - Agent-Based Threats
        - Cross-Site Scripting
        - Insider Threats
        - Social Engineering
        - Hacktivists
        - Script Kiddies
        - Cyber Crime Gangs
        - Black-and-White Hat Hackers

17. **Introducing Specialist Topics (15 mins)**
    - Advanced Coding: Integrated development environments, multiple programming languages, procedural programming, object-oriented programming, web development, coding libraries and packages, version control.
    - Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI): (data processing, data visualisation, machine learning, deep learning). Essentially, it is a crash course that gives a strong foundation in this field of computer science.
    - Machine learning and the whole artificial intelligence field are so important that it is integral to teach students what this is and how it works so that it isn’t just a mystery. The applications are endless, and we will show how we can apply ML and AI to cybersecurity and cryptography.

18. **Multiple Programming Languages (30 mins)**
    - Explain different programming languages, their uses and the best places to learn them. This would include C for briefly explaining procedural programming and C++ for object-oriented programming.

19. **Web Development (30 mins)**
    - I would touch on web development (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) and the different libraries and packages used (with examples in React).

20. **Machine Learning (30 mins)**
    - As this field is vast, the main focus will be to introduce Machine Learning (ML) and actually understand this domain. There will be a discussion of loss functions and how we develop, train, test, and evaluate ML models. I would provide students with excellent resources they can use to continue learning about this field.
    - Topics:
        - Machine Learning
        - Loss Functions
        - Developing ML Models
        - Training ML Models
        - Testing ML Models
        - Evaluating ML Models
