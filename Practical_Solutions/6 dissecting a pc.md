discussing the main components of a computer:
cpu: the cpu or central processing unit is the brain of the computer and it is responsible for executing instructions from programs and performing calculations. it processes data and controls the flow of information.

gpu: the gpu or graphics processing unit is specialized for rendering images and videos. it performs complex mathematical calculations required for graphics rendering making it crucial for gaming, video editing, and other graphics intensive tasks.

ram: the ram or random access memory is the computer's short term memory, where data and programs that are currently running are stored for quick access and it allows for fast read and write operations, enabling the cpu to quickly retrieve information 

motherboard: the motherboard is the main circuit board that connects all components of the computer, it provides the necessary electrical connections and communication pathways between the cpu, ram, and storage and it also houses the bios which initializes and manages hardware components 

psu: the psu or power supply unit supplies the rest of the pc's parts with electricity 

storage: storage consists of hard drives or more recently ssds/solid state drives, these drives store programs and data permanently. hard disk drives use a spinning disk to store data while ssds use flash memory for faster access and reliability 

cooling system: the cooling system which includes fans, heat sinks, and at times, liquid cooling setups. the cooling system is responsible for dissipating the heat produced by the cpu, gpu, and all the other components allowing the computer to run better and prevent hardware damage and system instability. 

case: the case houses and protects all the components of the computer, it provides physical structure and airflow management to maintain optimal performance.
