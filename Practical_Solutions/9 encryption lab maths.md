researching different types of encryption algorithms:

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard): A widely used encryption standard adopted by the us government. It supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits. AES is used in secure file transfer, disk encryption, ssl/tls, and vpns

DES (Data Encryption Standard) and 3DES (Triple DES): des is an older encryption standard with a 56 bit key, now considered insecure due to its short key length. 3DES enhances security by applying des encryption three times with different keys. These are used in legacy systems, though being phased out in favor of more secure algorithms like aes.

RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4): A stream cipher known for its simplicity and speed. However, vulnerabilities have been discovered, making it less secure than modern alternatives. RC4 was previously used in ssl/tls and wep, but now is largely deprecated.

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman): One of the first public-key cryptosystems, widely used for secure data transmission. It relies on the computational difficulty of factoring large prime numbers. RSA is used in secure email (pgp), ssl/tls certificates, and digital signatures.

ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography): Uses the mathematical properties of elliptic curves to provide security with smaller key sizes compared to rsa. It’s gaining popularity due to its efficiency. ecc is used in mobile devices, ssl/tls, and cryptocurrency (bitcoin, ethereum).

DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm): Used primarily for digital signatures. It’s part of the Digital Signature Standard (DSS). dsa is used for authenticating digital documents and software.

SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) family: Includes SHA-1, SHA-2 (SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512), and SHA-3. These algorithms produce a fixed-size hash from variable-size input data. sha is used for data integrity verification, digital signatures, and password hashing.

MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5): Once widely used for checksums and data integrity verification. Now considered insecure due to vulnerability to collision attacks. md5 is used in legacy systems, but being replaced by more secure hash functions.

Bcrypt: A password hashing function designed to be computationally intensive to mitigate brute-force attacks. Bcrypt is used for password storage and verification.
