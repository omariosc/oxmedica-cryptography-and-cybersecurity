# Practical 14: Cisco Packet Tracer Lab

## Overview

This practical exercise is designed to introduce you to the Cisco Packet Tracer software tool, which is used for network simulation and visualization. You will learn how to create and analyze network topologies. This session will take about 30 minutes to complete.

## Task

### Part 1: Introduction to Cisco Packet Tracer (10 minutes)

1. **What is Cisco Packet Tracer?**
   - Cisco Packet Tracer is a network simulation tool that allows you to create network topologies and simulate network configurations.
   - It is used for learning and teaching networking concepts, including routing, switching, and network security.

2. **Installing Cisco Packet Tracer:**
   - Download and install Cisco Packet Tracer from the official website: [Cisco Packet Tracer Download](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer).
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

3. **Cisco Packet Tracer Interface:**
   - Open Cisco Packet Tracer and familiarize yourself with the interface.
   - Main components include:
     - **Logical Workspace:** Area where you create and visualize network topologies.
     - **Device-Type Selection Box:** Contains network devices you can add to the workspace.
     - **Network Component Box:** Contains specific network components (e.g., routers, switches).
     - **Configuration Pane:** Used to configure devices and view simulation results.

### Part 2: Creating a Network Topology (10 minutes)

1. **Adding Devices:**
   - Open Cisco Packet Tracer and select network devices (e.g., routers, switches, PCs) from the Device-Type Selection Box.
   - Drag and drop the devices onto the Logical Workspace.

2. **Connecting Devices:**
   - Use the Connection tool to connect the devices with appropriate cables (e.g., copper straight-through, fiber optic).
   - Ensure that devices are correctly connected to allow communication.

3. **Configuring Devices:**
   - Click on each device to open its configuration window.
   - Configure the device settings, such as IP addresses, subnet masks, and routing protocols.

4. **Example Topology:**
   ```markdown
   **Simple Network Topology:**
   - Devices: 1 Router, 2 Switches, 4 PCs
   - Connections: Router connected to both switches, each switch connected to 2 PCs
   - Configuration: Assign IP addresses to all devices in the same subnet
   ```

### Part 3: Simulating Network Traffic (10 minutes)

1. **Simulation Mode:**
   - Switch to Simulation Mode to observe network traffic.
   - Use the Add Simple PDU tool to send test packets between devices.

2. **Capturing Packets:**
   - Monitor the packet flow and capture packets to analyze network behavior.
   - Observe the path taken by the packets and any potential issues.

3. **Troubleshooting:**
   - Identify and troubleshoot any connectivity issues or misconfigurations in your network topology.
   - Make necessary adjustments to ensure successful communication between devices.

### Part 4: Exercises (10 minutes)

1. **Exercise 1: Create a Basic Network Topology**
   - TODO: Add 1 router, 2 switches, and 4 PCs to the Logical Workspace.
   - TODO: Connect the devices using appropriate cables.
   - TODO: Assign IP addresses to all devices in the same subnet.
   - TODO: Verify connectivity by pinging between PCs.

2. **Exercise 2: Configure a Static Route**
   - TODO: Create a network topology with 2 routers connected via a serial link.
   - TODO: Add a switch and 2 PCs to each router.
   - TODO: Configure static routes on each router to enable communication between PCs on different networks.
   - TODO: Verify connectivity by pinging between PCs on different networks.

3. **Exercise 3: Simulate Network Traffic**
   - TODO: Create a network topology with a router, a switch, and 3 PCs.
   - TODO: Assign IP addresses and configure the devices.
   - TODO: Use the Simulation Mode to send test packets between PCs.
   - TODO: Capture and analyze the packets to observe the network behavior.
