# Practical 15: Cybersecurity Legislation and Regulation

## Overview

This practical exercise is designed to help you understand the importance of cybersecurity legislation and regulation. You will engage in a debate on various cybersecurity topics, exploring different perspectives and arguments. This session will take about 30 minutes to complete.

## Task

### Part 1: Choosing Questions and Preparation (10 minutes)

1. **Choose from the Following Questions:**
   - Should companies be held legally responsible for data breaches involving customer information?


   (((***Customers who input their information on another database fully acknowledge and accept the fact that their data is at risk of a cyberattack, therefore, customers have no right to pursue legal action against any company for that matter.-***)))


   - Should ethical hacking be legalised and regulated to improve cybersecurity measures?

    (((***Without simulating a cyberattack, you wouldn't be able to efficentily protect your data. therefore, ethical hacking should be encouraged in cybersecurity practices.***)))

   - Should governments have the authority to conduct mass surveillance for cybersecurity purposes?

   (((***While some may argue that mass surveillance will in turn decrease crime rate, ethically it doesn't hold up an argument, not to mention the possible prospect of a massive data leak or an unauthorized or corrupt member using that information maliciously.***)))
   
2. **Divide into Groups:**
   - Divide students into two groups for each question, with one group arguing in favour and the other against.
