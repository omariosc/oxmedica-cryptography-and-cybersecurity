# Practical 17: DDoS Lab

## Overview

This practical exercise is designed to help you understand Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. You will research an example of a DDoS attack, how it occurred, its consequences, and the preventative/safeguarding measures that followed. You will work in groups and present your findings at the end of the session. This session will take about 1 hour to complete.

## Task

### Part 1: Researching a DDoS Attack (20 minutes)

1. **Find an Example of a DDoS Attack:**
   - Research online to find a documented example of a DDoS attack. Some notable examples include:
     - The 2016 Dyn DDoS attack
     - The GitHub DDoS attack in 2018
     - The Mirai botnet attack
     - The AWS DDoS attack in 2020

2. **Understand How the Attack Occurred:**
   - Investigate the details of the attack:
     - What was the target of the attack?
     - How was the attack executed? (e.g., types of DDoS methods used, such as HTTP flooding, SYN flooding, DNS amplification)
     - What vulnerabilities or weaknesses did the attackers exploit?

3. **Identify the Consequences:**
   - Analyze the impact of the attack:
     - What were the immediate effects on the targeted organization or service?
     - What was the financial, operational, and reputational impact?
     - How long did it take to mitigate the attack and restore normal operations?

4. **Explore Preventative and Safeguarding Measures:**
   - Research the measures taken to prevent future attacks:
     - What security enhancements were implemented following the attack?
     - What best practices or technologies (e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection systems, rate limiting) were recommended or adopted?
     - How can organizations prepare for and respond to DDoS attacks more effectively in the future?

### Part 2: Group Work and Preparation (20 minutes)

1. **Work in Groups:**
   - Split up into 5 groups.
   - Each group will select one DDoS attack to research and analyze.

2. **Prepare Your Presentation:**
   - Summarize your findings in a clear and concise manner.
   - Create visual aids (e.g., slides, diagrams) to support your presentation.
   - Assign roles within your group (e.g., presenter, researcher, designer) to ensure a smooth presentation.

### Part 3: Group Presentations (20 minutes)

1. **Present Your Findings:**
   - Each group will have 4 minutes to present their research on the selected DDoS attack.
   - Ensure that your presentation covers the following points:
     - Overview of the attack (target, execution, vulnerabilities)
     - Consequences and impact
     - Preventative and safeguarding measures

2. **Q&A Session:**
   - After each presentation, there will be a brief Q&A session where other students and the instructor can ask questions.

## Summary

- You have researched a real-world example of a DDoS attack.
- You have analyzed how the attack occurred, its consequences, and the measures taken to prevent future attacks.
- You have worked in groups to prepare and present your findings.

## Submission

- Document your research and presentation materials.
- Include the names of all group members at the top of the document.
- Save your progress and ensure all solutions are documented and submitted to GitHub.
- Save the file with the name `"17 DDoS Lab.md"` in the `"Practical Solutions"` directory.
