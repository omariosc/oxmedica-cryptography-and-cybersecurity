# Practical 19: Research Malware Lab

## Overview

This practical exercise is designed to help you understand malware and viruses through research and analysis. You will investigate a specific type of malware or virus, how it works, its consequences, and preventative measures. This session will take about 30 minutes to complete.

## Task

### Part 1: Researching Malware and Viruses (20 minutes)

1. **Find an Example of Malware or Virus:**
   - Research online to find a documented example of malware or a virus. Some notable examples include:
     - WannaCry Ransomware
     - Stuxnet Worm
     - Zeus Trojan
     - Cryptolocker Ransomware

2. **Understand How the Malware or Virus Works:**
   - Investigate the details of the malware or virus:
     - What is the primary method of infection (e.g., email attachments, malicious downloads, exploiting vulnerabilities)?
     - How does it spread to other systems?
     - What actions does it perform on the infected system (e.g., data theft, encryption, system damage)?

3. **Identify the Consequences:**
   - Analyze the impact of the malware or virus:
     - What were the immediate effects on the infected systems?
     - What was the financial, operational, and reputational impact on individuals or organizations?
     - How long did it take to mitigate the infection and restore normal operations?

4. **Explore Preventative and Safeguarding Measures:**
   - Research the measures taken to prevent future infections:
     - What security enhancements were implemented following the infection?
     - What best practices or technologies (e.g., antivirus software, firewalls, user education) were recommended or adopted?
     - How can individuals and organizations prepare for and respond to malware or virus attacks more effectively in the future?

### Part 2: Group Work and Preparation (10 minutes)

1. **Work in Groups:**
   - Form groups of 3-4 students.
   - Each group will select one type of malware or virus to research and analyze.

2. **Prepare Your Report:**
   - Summarize your findings in a clear and concise manner.

## Summary

- You have researched a real-world example of malware or a virus.
- You have analyzed how the malware or virus works, its consequences, and the measures taken to prevent future infections.
- You have worked in groups to prepare and present your findings.

## Submission

- Document your research and presentation materials.
- Include the names of all group members at the top of the document.
- Save your progress and ensure all solutions are documented and submitted to GitHub.
- Save the file with the name `"19 Research Malware Lab.md"` in the `"Practical Solutions"` directory.
