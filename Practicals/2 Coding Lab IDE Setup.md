# Practical 2: Coding Lab IDE Setup

## Overview

This practical exercise is designed to help students set up their coding environment using VSCode with Python, pip, and relevant packages. If there are any issues with setting up VSCode, we will focus on using Google Colab as an alternative. This task should take about 15 minutes to complete.

## Task

### Part 1: Setting Up VSCode

1. **Install VSCode:**
   - Download and install Visual Studio Code (VSCode) from the official website: [VSCode Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. **Install Python:**
   - Download and install Python from the official website: [Python Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. **Set Up pip:**
   - Ensure that pip (Python's package installer) is installed. It is typically included with Python installations. You can verify by running the command: `python -m pip --version`

4. **Install Relevant Packages:**
   - Use pip to install necessary packages. For example: `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib`

5. **Configure VSCode for Python:**
   - Open VSCode and install the Python extension from the Extensions Marketplace.
   - Configure the Python interpreter in VSCode by selecting the installed Python version.

### Part 2: Alternative Setup with Google Colab

1. **Access Google Colab:**
   - If there are issues with setting up VSCode, use Google Colab as an alternative: [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

2. **Set Up a New Notebook:**
   - Create a new notebook in Google Colab.
   - Verify that Python is available and install any necessary packages using the `!pip install` command. For example: `!pip install numpy pandas matplotlib`
