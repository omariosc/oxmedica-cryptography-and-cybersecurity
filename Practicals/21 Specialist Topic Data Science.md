Part 1: A crash course on data processing, learning about collecting data online, using existing datasets, types of data, and issues with data, with a final focus on data cleaning and manipulation with practical exercises. All of this will be supplemented with the Python programming language. We will focus on datasets we can use for data visualisation and ML.
45 mins

Part 2: This is another crash course on data visualisation. I will discuss different visualisation libraries in Python and methods of understanding how to use them. We will focus on data visualisation methods using datasets they collected in the previous crash course on data processing. We will learn how to create nice visualisations and components of plots and graphs.
