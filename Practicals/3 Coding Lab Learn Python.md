# Practical 3: Coding Lab Learn Python

## Overview

This practical exercise is designed to help you start learning Python through Codecademy. If you were unable to set up your coding environment in the previous session, you can do so now. This task should take about 45 minutes to complete.

## Task

### Part 1: Setup (if needed)

1. **VSCode Setup:**
   - If you were unable to set up VSCode and Python in the previous session, follow the steps provided in Practical 2 to complete the setup.

2. **Google Colab Setup:**
   - If you encountered issues with VSCode, use Google Colab as an alternative. Refer to the steps in Practical 2 to set up a new notebook in Google Colab.

### Part 2: Learn Python using the Course Reader

We do not have complete access to Codecademy so we will use the code examples in the course reader. Please take it out, if you do not have it you can open it in the following file `Important Documents/Course Reader.pdf`.

Copy and paste the different code blocks into a new python file called `3 Coding Lab Learning Python.ipynb`. Use a separate block for each individual taski the course reader.

This file should be inside the `Practicals` directory.
