# Practical 5: Architecture of Computers Workshop

## Overview

This practical exercise is designed to introduce you to computer architecture, including Boolean logic, truth tables, number systems, memory, operating systems, CPUs, and GPUs. We will provide assembly code examples and demonstrate a buffer overflow in action. You will complete the provided interactive notebook during this 2-hour session.

## Task

### Part 1: Discussion and Demonstration (1 hour)

1. **Boolean Logic and Truth Tables:**
   - Discuss the basics of Boolean logic and how it is used in computer systems.
   - Provide examples of truth tables for AND, OR, and NOT gates.
   <!-- - Example:
   | A | B | AND | OR | NOT A |
   |---|---|-----|----|-------|
   | 0 | 0 |  0  | 0  |   1   |
   | 0 | 1 |  0  | 1  |   1   |
   | 1 | 0 |  0  | 1  |   0   |
   | 1 | 1 |  1  | 1  |   0   |
   -->

2. **Number Systems:**
   - Explain different number systems such as binary, decimal, and hexadecimal.
   - Demonstrate how to convert between these number systems.

3. **Memory and Operating Systems:**
   - Discuss the types of memory (RAM, ROM) and their roles in a computer.
   - Provide an overview of how operating systems manage hardware and software resources.

4. **CPUs and GPUs:**
   - Explain the functions of the CPU and GPU in a computer system.
   - Discuss the differences between CPUs and GPUs in terms of processing tasks.

5. **Assembly Code Examples:**
   - Provide simple examples of assembly code to illustrate low-level programming concepts.
   - Demonstrate how assembly code interacts with the computer's hardware.

6. **Buffer Overflow Demonstration:**
   - Show an example of a buffer overflow and explain how it can be exploited.
   - Discuss methods to prevent buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

### Part 2: Interactive Workbook (1 hour)

1. **Complete the Supplied Worksheet:**
   - You will be provided with a Python interactive workbook.
   - Work through the exercises and questions in the workbook, which will cover topics discussed in Part 1.

## Submission

- Complete the interactive workbook and save your progress.
- Submit your completed workbook to your GitHub repository.
