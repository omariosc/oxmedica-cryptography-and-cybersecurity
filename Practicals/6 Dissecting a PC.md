# Practical 6: Dissecting a PC

## Overview

This practical exercise is designed to show you how real computers are built, including the installation of an operating system. While we will not be building a computer from scratch, we will focus on removing certain components and showing the insides of a computer. This session will take about 1 hour to complete. There is no submission required for this practical.

## Task

### Part 1: Introduction to Computer Components (15 minutes)

1. **Overview of a Computer:**
   - Discuss the main components of a computer and their functions.
   - Components to cover:
     - CPU (Central Processing Unit)
     - GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)
     - RAM (Random Access Memory)
     - Motherboard
     - Power Supply Unit (PSU)
     - Hard Drive/SSD (Storage)
     - Cooling System
     - Case

2. **Tools and Safety:**
   - Explain the tools needed to safely open a computer case.
   - Emphasize the importance of grounding to avoid static electricity damage.

### Part 2: Disassembling a PC (45 minutes)

1. **Opening the Case:**
   - Demonstrate how to open a computer case safely.
   - Show the location of screws and latches that need to be removed.

2. **Removing Components:**
   - Demonstrate how to remove the following components:
     - RAM: Show how to release the clips and carefully remove the RAM sticks.
     - Hard Drive/SSD: Show how to disconnect power and data cables, and remove mounting screws.
     - GPU: Show how to release the PCIe slot latch and remove the GPU.
     - CPU: Show how to remove the CPU cooler, unlock the CPU socket, and remove the CPU.
   - Discuss the function of each component as it is removed.

### Part 3: Installing an Operating System (Stretch Exercise)

1. **Installing the Operating System:**
   - We will not have time to install an operating system during this session, but you can discuss the process with the students. Here are some links to install Windows and Linux.
       - [How to Install Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10)
       - [How to Install Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop)

## Summary

- This practical exercise provides hands-on experience with the internal components of a computer and the process of installing an operating system.
- It aims to enhance your understanding of how computers are assembled and maintained.

There is no submission required for this practical. Enjoy exploring the inner workings of a computer!
Motherboard: The main circuit board that connects all components together, such as CPU, RAM, storage devices, and peripherals.

Central Processing Unit (CPU): The brain of the computer that performs instructions from programs and processes data.

Random Access Memory (RAM): Temporary storage that holds data and instructions that the CPU needs while actively running programs.

Storage Devices: Permanent storage for data and files, including:

Hard Disk Drive (HDD): Uses rotating disks to store data magnetically.
Solid State Drive (SSD): Faster than HDDs, uses flash memory for storage.
Power Supply Unit (PSU): Converts electricity from a wall outlet into a usable form for the computer.

Graphics Processing Unit (GPU): Handles rendering images, videos, and animations, critical for gaming and graphics-intensive tasks.

Cooling System: Includes fans, heatsinks, and sometimes liquid cooling solutions to dissipate heat generated by the CPU and GPU
