  1. RAM
  2. **ROLE**
     - RAM (Random Access Memory) plays a crucial role in a computer system as it serves as a temporary storage space that the CPU (Central Processing Unit) can access quickly to store and retrieve data. Here are the key roles of RAM in a computer system: RAM is the primary type of volatile memory in a computer system, meaning that it requires power to retain stored information. When you turn off your computer, the data stored in RAM is lost. 
    
     - **Inputs** to RAM: -Data and Instructions -Operating System Management - User interaction
     - **Outputs** to RAM: -Processed Data -Display and user interface -Temprorly storage
     -**INTERFACES** RAM (Random Access Memory) interfaces with several other components and systems within a computer to facilitate efficient data processing and system operation. These components are like : CPU, MOTHERBOARD, AND STORAGE DEVICES.

## Part 2  
   1. - AND Gate: The AND gate takes two inputs, A and B.
Its output will be high (1) only when both inputs A and B are high (1). In other words, the output of the AND gate (let's call it C) can be represented as: C = A . B where . denotes the AND operation. 

- NOT Gate: The NOT gate (also known as an inverter) takes the output of the AND gate (C) as its input.
It outputs the opposite value of its input. Therefore, if the input C is high (1), the output Q (after the NOT gate) will be low (0), and vice versa.
Mathematically, the output Q can be represented as: Q-C Where C denotes the NOT operation on C
 
 Summary:
The described circuit with an AND gate followed by a NOT gate implements the logical operation where the output Q is high (1) only when both inputs A and B are low (0), and Q is low (0) when at least one of the inputs A or B is high (1). In essence, the circuit acts as a NAND (NOT-AND) gate, which produces the inverse of the AND gate's output.
   
2. -  Circuit Description:
Inputs: A, B
Intermediate Output (AND gate): C = A AND B
Final Output (NOT gate): Q = NOT(C)
Truth Table: 
A	B	C (A AND B)	Q (NOT C)
0	0	0	1
0	1	0	1
1	0	0	1
1	1	1	0 
  
  Explanation:
A and B are the input values, which can each be either 0 (false) or 1 (true).
C represents the output of the AND gate, which computes the logical AND operation between A and B.
Q represents the final output after passing through the NOT gate, which computes the logical NOT operation on C.
Truth Table Breakdown:
When A = 0 and B = 0:
C = 0 (0 AND 0)
Q = NOT(0) = 1
When A = 0 and B = 1:
C = 0 (0 AND 1)
Q = NOT(0) = 1
When A = 1 and B = 0:
C = 0 (1 AND 0)
Q = NOT(0) = 1
When A = 1 and B = 1:
C = 1 (1 AND 1)
Q = NOT(1) = 0
Summary:
This truth table clearly shows the behavior of the circuit:
Q is 1 (true) only when both A and B are 0 (false).
Q is 0 (false) when at least one of A or B is 1 (true).
This logical configuration effectively implements a NAND (NOT-AND) gate, where the output is the negation of the AND operation between A and B.
