1.  What are the components of database system architecture
The five major components of a database are hardware, software, data, procedure, and database access language 
 Storage Manager is a program that provides an interface between the data stored in the database and the queries received. It is also known as Database Control System. It maintains the consistency and integrity of the database by applying the constraints and executing the DCL statements.

 1. RELATIONAL ALGEBRA is a widely used procedural query language. It collects instances of relations as input and gives occurrences of relations as output. It uses various operations to perform this action. SQL Relational algebra query operations are performed recursively on a relation. The output of these operations is a new relation, which might be formed from one or more input relations.    
 ---  The SELECT operation is used for selecting a subset of the tuples according to a given selection condition. Sigma(Ïƒ)Symbol denotes it. It is used as an expression to choose tuples which meet the selection condition. Select operator selects tuples that satisfy a given predicate.
- What is union operation with example?
The Union operator combines the results of two or more queries into a distinct single result set that includes all the rows that belong to all queries in the Union. In this operation, it combines two more queries and removes the duplicates. For example, the table 'A' has 1,2, and 3 and the table 'B' has 3,4,5 
- What is a projection in relational algebra?
In relational terminology, projection is defined as taking a vertical subset from the columns of a single table that retains the unique rows. This kind of SELECT statement returns some of the columns and all the rows in a table.

- The Cartesian Product of sets A and B is defined as the set of all ordered pairs (x, y) such that x belongs to A and y belongs to B

1. An ER diagram typically consists of entities (represented as rectangles), attributes (listed within the entity rectangle), and relationships (represented as diamond shapes connecting entities). Additionally, cardinality and participation constraints are depicted using symbols like crow's feet and lines. 
  - In an Entity-Relationship (ER) model, attributes are features that describe entities or relationships. They can be simple, composite, derived, multi-valued, or key attributes. Simple attributes are basic, while composite ones are made up of smaller parts
