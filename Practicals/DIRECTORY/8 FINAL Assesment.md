2. ## Python script

def count_words(file_path):
    word_count = {}
    
    # Open the file for reading
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        # Read each line in the file
        for line in file:
            # Split the line into words
            words = line.split()
            # Count each word
            for word in words:
                # Remove punctuation marks if any
                word = word.strip('.,!?()[]{};:"\'')
                # Convert to lowercase to ignore case sensitivity
                word = word.lower()
                # Update the word count dictionary
                if word:
                    if word in word_count:
                        word_count[word] += 1
                    else:
                        word_count[word] = 1
    
    return word_count

def main():
    file_path = 'sample.txt'  # Replace with your file path
    word_count = count_words(file_path)
    
    # Print the word count results
    for word, count in word_count.items():
        print(f'{word}: {count}')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()


## Description of the Script's Processing:

- Function count_words(file_path):

Purpose: This function reads a text file specified by file_path and counts the occurrences of each word in the file.
Steps:
Initializes an empty dictionary word_count to store word counts.
Opens the file specified by file_path in read mode ('r') using open().
Iterates through each line in the file using a for loop.
Splits each line into words using line.split(). By default, this splits by whitespace.
Iterates through each word and strips off any punctuation marks (.,!?()[]{};:"') using word.strip().
Converts each word to lowercase using word.lower() to ensure case insensitivity.
Updates the word_count dictionary: if the word is already a key, increment its count; otherwise, initialize its count to 1.
Returns: The function returns the word_count dictionary containing word counts for all words in the file.

The script first calls main() when executed (if __name__ == '__main__': main()).
It reads the file specified by file_path, processes it to count words, and outputs the results.

This script efficiently counts words while handling basic text preprocessing like stripping punctuation and converting words to lowercase to ensure accurate counts.


3. ## RAM is like a super-fast, temporary workspace in your computer where everything happens quickly and smoothly.

- Role of RAM:
RAM's main job is to keep track of all the things your computer is currently working on. It holds onto programs, files, and data that your computer needs to access right away.

- Inputs to RAM:

From CPU: RAM gets data and instructions from the CPU, which tells it what to work on next.
From Storage: It also grabs data from your hard drive or SSD whenever you open a file or start a program.

- Outputs from RAM:

To CPU: RAM sends back processed data and results to the CPU so your computer can keep running smoothly.
To Storage: It writes updated data back to your storage devices when you save files or make changes.


- Interaction with CPU:

Fast Access: RAM acts like a super-fast delivery service for the CPU, providing it with the data it needs almost instantly.
Helps with Multitasking: It allows you to switch between different programs and tasks quickly because it keeps everything handy for the CPU.
Interaction with Storage Devices:

Data Manager: RAM acts as a temporary middleman between your storage devices (like your hard drive) and the CPU. It pulls data from storage when needed and holds onto it until the CPU is ready to work on it.
Speed Booster: By keeping frequently used data in RAM, your computer can access it much faster than if it had to fetch it from the slower storage devices every time.

- Interaction with Operating System:

Memory Manager: The operating system (like Windows or macOS) uses RAM to manage how programs and data are handled. It makes sure RAM is used efficiently and can even borrow space on your storage devices if needed (known as virtual memory).

- Key Points:

RAM is temporary memory that clears out when you turn off your computer.
It's essential for keeping your computer running smoothly and quickly, especially when you're multitasking or using demanding programs.
The more RAM your computer has and the faster it is, the better your overall computer performance will be.
In simple terms, RAM is like your computer's quick-access memory, ensuring everything runs smoothly and swiftly so you can work, play, and browse without slowdowns.

4. **Database**

- -- Table for Products
## CREATE TABLE Products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL
);

-- Table for Customers
## CREATE TABLE Customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    address TEXT
);

-- Table for Orders
## CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE NOT NULL,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id)
);

-- Table for Order Details (to store products within each order)
## CREATE TABLE OrderDetails (
    order_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    quantity INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    PRIMARY KEY (order_id, product_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES Orders(order_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES Products(product_id)
);


## Explanation of the Schema:

- Products Table:

product_id: Unique identifier for each product (primary key).
name: Name of the product.
description: Description of the product (can be null).
price: Price of the product, stored as a decimal number with 10 digits in total and 2 decimal places.


- Customers Table:

customer_id: Unique identifier for each customer (primary key).
name: Name of the customer.
email: Email address of the customer (unique constraint ensures each email is unique).
address: Address of the customer (can be null).


- Orders Table:

order_id: Unique identifier for each order (primary key).
customer_id: Foreign key referencing the customer_id in the Customers table, indicating which customer placed the order.
order_date: Date when the order was placed.
total_amount: Total amount of the order, stored as a decimal number with 10 digits in total and 2 decimal places.


- OrderDetails Table:

order_id: Foreign key referencing the order_id in the Orders table, indicating which order this detail belongs to.
product_id: Foreign key referencing the product_id in the Products table, indicating which product was ordered.
quantity: Quantity of the product ordered in this specific order (defaulted to 1).


- Additional Notes:

Primary Keys: Each table has a primary key (product_id, customer_id, order_id, and (order_id, product_id) in OrderDetails) to uniquely identify records.
Foreign Keys: Ensure data integrity by linking tables (customer_id in Orders references customer_id in Customers, and product_id in OrderDetails references product_id in Products).
Data Types: Appropriate data types (INT, VARCHAR, DECIMAL, DATE, TEXT) are chosen based on the nature of the data they store.
This schema provides a foundation for storing and managing product information, customer details, orders, and order details efficiently in an online store database.

5. **VPN** 
Imagine you're sending a secret message to your friend, but you're worried someone might intercept it. So, you decide to write the message in a secret code that only you and your friend understand. That's kind of how a VPN works, but for your internet connection.

Here’s how it works: When you connect to a VPN, it creates a secure tunnel between your device and a server somewhere else on the internet. This tunnel encrypts all the data you send and receive, making it unreadable to anyone who might try to spy on you. It's like putting your message in an envelope that only your friend can open.

Advantages? Well, your online activities become more private because your real IP address is hidden. It also helps protect you when you're using public Wi-Fi, like at a coffee shop, because it keeps your information safe from hackers.

But it's not all perfect. Using a VPN might slow down your internet speed a bit because of the encryption process. And not all VPN services are equally trustworthy, so you have to be careful to pick one that doesn't log your activities.

Overall, a VPN is like having a secure, private tunnel for your internet traffic, which can be really handy for staying safe and private online.

6. ## CRYPTOGRAPHY
Public key cryptography, also known as asymmetric cryptography, is a method of encryption where a pair of keys (a public key and a private key) is used to encrypt and decrypt data. It differs significantly from symmetric key cryptography, where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
 
 ## How Public Key Cryptography Works:

- Key Pair Generation:

Public Key: This key is made freely available to anyone who wants to send encrypted messages to the owner of the key.
Private Key: This key is kept secret and known only to the owner. It is used to decrypt messages encrypted with the corresponding public key.

- Encryption and Decryption:

If Alice wants to send a secure message to Bob using public key cryptography, she obtains Bob's public key.
Alice encrypts her message using Bob's public key.
Bob receives the encrypted message and decrypts it using his private key, which only he possesses.

- Digital Signatures:

Public key cryptography also allows for the creation of digital signatures. A sender can use their private key to sign a message, and the recipient can verify the authenticity of the message using the sender's public key.

## Differences from Symmetric Key Cryptography:

- Key Management: In symmetric key cryptography, both parties must share the same secret key, which introduces the challenge of securely distributing and managing keys. In contrast, public key cryptography eliminates the need for both parties to share a secret key beforehand.

- Scalability: Public key cryptography is more scalable in scenarios involving multiple parties. Each participant needs only to know the public keys of others to securely communicate, whereas symmetric key cryptography requires each pair of participants to share a unique secret key.

- Security: While both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography are secure when implemented correctly, public key cryptography offers additional security benefits due to the separation of keys. Even if a public key is intercepted, it cannot be used to decrypt messages without the corresponding private key.


## Example of Secure Communication Using Public Key Cryptography:
Let's say Alice wants to securely send a confidential document to Bob:

- Key Generation: Bob generates a key pair consisting of a public key (known to everyone) and a private key (known only to Bob).

- Distribution of Public Key: Bob publishes his public key on his website or sends it directly to Alice through a secure channel.

- Encryption: Alice retrieves Bob's public key and uses it to encrypt the document she wants to send to Bob.

- Transmission: Alice sends the encrypted document to Bob over the internet. Even if someone intercepts the encrypted document, they cannot decrypt it without Bob's private key.

- Decryption: Upon receiving the encrypted document, Bob uses his private key to decrypt it and access the original content.

- Digital Signatures (Optional): Bob can sign a reply to Alice using his private key. Alice can verify the signature using Bob's public key to ensure the message came from Bob and was not tampered with.

In summary, public key cryptography provides a powerful method for secure communication and digital signatures, offering advantages in key distribution, scalability, and security over symmetric key cryptography in certain applications.
