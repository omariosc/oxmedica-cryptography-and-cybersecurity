1. **Companies being held legally responsible for data breaches:** (FOR)

- **Protect People**: When companies collect our information, they should keep it safe. If they fail, they should fix the problem and take responsibility.
   
- **Trust**: We trust companies with our data. If they don't keep it safe, it's hard to trust them again. Holding them responsible helps make sure they work harder to protect our information.

- **Fairness**: If someone breaks into a company's system and steals data, it's not our fault. The company collected our data, so they should be responsible for keeping it safe.

- **Learning**: When companies face consequences for data breaches, they learn to improve their security. This makes everyone's data safer in the long run.

- **Transparency**: Legal responsibility encourages companies to be open about what data they collect and how they protect it. This helps us make better choices about who we trust with our information.

- **Impact on Customers**: Data breaches can lead to identity theft, financial loss, and damage their reputation. Holding companies responsible ensures they take steps to minimize these risks and inform customers promptly if a breach occurs.

2. **Legalization and regulation of ethical hacking:** (AGAINST)

   - **Could Make Problems Worse:** Legalizing hacking could give bad people an excuse to do bad things and call it ethical. It might be hard to tell the difference.
   
   - **Could Hurt by Accident:** Even with rules, hacking could accidentally break things or let out secrets. Rules might not stop all the bad things from happening.
   
   - **Costs Too Much:** Making rules and keeping people safe from ethical hacking could cost a lot of money. It might take away from other ways to stay safe online.
   
   - **Might Not Feel Safe:** Even if itâ€™s allowed, people might worry about their privacy and if they are safe from hacking.

3. **Government authority for mass surveillance for cybersecurity purposes:** (FOR)

- **Spotting Threats Early:** Surveillance helps governments catch cyber threats before they cause harm.

- **Fast Action:** It allows quick responses to cyber attacks to minimize damage.

- **Covering More Ground:** Surveillance monitors a lot of users and systems at once, protecting a wide area from cyber threats.

- **Protecting the Country:** It's essential for national security against cyber attacks from different sources.

- **Stopping Problems Before They Start:** Surveillance detects patterns in cyber activities to prevent attacks before they happen.

- **Finding Culprits:** It helps identify who's behind cyber attacks and stop them from doing more damage.

- **Keeping People Safe:** It protects personal information, money systems, and important infrastructure.

- **Working Together:** Surveillance helps countries work together to fight cybercrime globally.

- **Being Fair and Safe:** Surveillance is done under strict rules to protect privacy and trust.

- **Adapting to Change:** It's important to keep up with new technology to stay ahead of cyber threats and keep digital systems safe.
