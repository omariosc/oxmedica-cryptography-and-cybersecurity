# Practical 17: DDoS Lab

### Part 1: Researching a DDoS Attack

#### How the Attack Occurred:
- **Target:** GitHub's website.
- **Execution:** Attackers used a technique called UDP reflection/amplification via memcached servers. They sent fake requests to these servers, which then flooded GitHub with excessive traffic.
- **Exploited vulnerabilities:** The attack leveraged unprotected memcached servers that amplified the traffic aimed at GitHub.

#### Consequences:
- **Effects:** GitHub suffered from frequent outages and slowdowns lasting several hours.
- **Impact:** The attack disrupted GitHub's services, affecting developers worldwide and damaging user trust and productivity.
- **Mitigation:** GitHub implemented rate limiting and stricter IP controls to stop the attack.

#### Preventative and Safeguarding Measures:
- **Security Enhancements:** GitHub upgraded its network and improved traffic filtering.
- **Technologies:** They deployed advanced monitoring tools, firewalls, and DDoS protection services.
- **Future Readiness:** GitHub now monitors proactively and responds quickly to prevent similar attacks.
