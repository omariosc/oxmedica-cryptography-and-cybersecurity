#### Example: WannaCry Ransomware

##### How WannaCry Works
- **Infection Method:** WannaCry primarily spreads through phishing emails containing malicious attachments.
- **Spread:** It propagates within networks by exploiting the EternalBlue vulnerability in Windows SMB protocol.
- **Actions:** Once infected, WannaCry encrypts files on the system and demands ransom in Bitcoin.

##### Consequences
- **Effects:** Infected systems experienced data encryption, rendering files inaccessible.
- **Impact:** Organizations faced significant financial losses due to downtime and ransom payments. It damaged reputations and caused operational disruptions.
- **Mitigation:** Mitigation efforts involved patching vulnerable systems and deploying security updates. Recovery efforts varied, but many systems were restored after ransom payments or backups.

##### Preventative Measures
- **Enhancements:** Enhanced network segmentation and updated antivirus software.
- **Best Practices:** Improved user training on identifying phishing attempts and regular backup procedures.
- **Preparedness:** Continued monitoring for vulnerabilities and prompt patching to prevent similar attacks.
