### Main Components of a Computer and Their Functions

- **CPU**
   - *Function*: The CPU is the brain of the computer. It executes instructions from programs and processes data.
  
- **GPU**
   - *Function*: Primarily handles the rendering of images, videos, and animations. It's crucial for tasks requiring high graphical performance, such as gaming or video editing.

- **RAM**
   - *Function*: Serves as temporary storage that the CPU uses to store data that's currently in use or being processed. It allows for quick access and retrieval of data.

- **Motherboard**
   - *Function*: The main circuit board that connects and allows communication between all other components in the computer. It houses the CPU, RAM, and connectors for peripherals.

- **Power Supply Unit**
   - *Function*: Converts mains AC power to low-voltage regulated DC power for the internal components of the computer. It provides the necessary power for the entire system to function.s

- **Hard Drive/SSD**
   - *Function*: Stores data permanently (or semi-permanently in the case of SSDs). It retains information even when the computer is powered off. SSDs are faster than traditional hard drives due to their lack of moving parts.

- **Cooling System**
   - *Function*: Prevents overheating of components. It typically includes fans, heat sinks, and sometimes liquid cooling systems to dissipate heat generated by the CPU, GPU, and other components.

- **Case**
   - *Function*: Provides physical protection and organization for all internal components. It also facilitates airflow for cooling and houses external ports for peripherals.

- Explain the tools needed to safely open a computer case.
- Emphasize the importance of grounding to avoid static electricity damage.

To safely open a computer case, you'll need:

- **Tools**: A **Phillips-head screwdriver** for case screws and possibly a **flat-head screwdriver** for older models.
- **Static Protection**: Use an **anti-static wrist strap** or mat to prevent static electricity buildup. This is crucial to safeguard sensitive components like the motherboard and CPU from potential damage due to static discharge. Always wear the wrist strap connected to a grounded object or use an anti-static mat on your work surface to dissipate static charges safely.
