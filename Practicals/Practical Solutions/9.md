3. **Research Task:**
   - Research different types of encryption algorithms used in modern cryptography, such as symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, and hashing algorithms.
   - Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each type of encryption algorithm.

## Answer

### **Symmetric Encryption:**
   - **Advantages:** Efficient, fast, suitable for large amounts of data.
   - **Disadvantages:** Key distribution and management challenges, lacks inherent authentication.

### **Asymmetric Encryption (Public Key Encryption):**
   - **Advantages:** Simplifies key distribution, provides authentication and secure communication.
   - **Disadvantages:** Slower and computationally intensive, larger key sizes.

### **Hashing Algorithms:**
   - **Advantages:** Fast, ensures data integrity, fixed-size outputs.
   - **Disadvantages:** Non-reversible (one-way), possibility of collisions.
