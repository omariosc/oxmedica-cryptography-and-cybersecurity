    "# Practical 9: Cryptography Lab Maths\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This practical exercise is designed to introduce you to the mathematical principles behind encryption. You will learn how to encrypt a message using simple mathematical techniques. This session will take about 30 minutes to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1: Introduction to Encryption (10 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What is Encryption?**\n",
    "   - Encryption is the process of converting a plain text message into an unreadable format using a mathematical algorithm and a key.\n",
    "   - The purpose of encryption is to protect the confidentiality of the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Basic Concepts:**\n",
    "   - **Plaintext:** The original message that needs to be encrypted.\n",
    "   - **Ciphertext:** The encrypted message.\n",
    "   - **Key:** A piece of information used in the encryption process to convert plaintext into ciphertext and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Research Task:**\n",
    "   - Research different types of encryption algorithms used in modern cryptography, such as symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, and hashing algorithms.\n",
    "   - Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each type of encryption algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2: Caesar Cipher (10 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Introduction to Caesar Cipher:**\n",
    "   - The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.\n",
    "   - Example: With a shift of 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Encryption Process:**\n",
    "   - Choose a shift value (key).\n",
    "   - For each letter in the plaintext, find its corresponding letter in the ciphertext by shifting it by the chosen value.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example:**\n",
    "   - Plaintext: HELLO\n",
    "   - Key: 3\n",
    "   - Encryption Steps:\n",
    "     - H -> K\n",
    "     - E -> H\n",
    "     - L -> O\n",
    "     - L -> O\n",
    "     - O -> R\n",
    "   - Ciphertext: KHOOR\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Decryption Process:**\n",
    "   - To decrypt the message, shift each letter in the ciphertext back by the same value.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     - K -> H\n",
    "     - H -> E\n",
    "     - O -> L\n",
    "     - O -> L\n",
    "     - R -> O\n",
    "   - Plaintext: HELLO\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 3: Vigenère Cipher (10 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Introduction to Vigenère Cipher:**\n",
    "   - The Vigenère Cipher is a more complex form of substitution cipher that uses a keyword to shift letters by different amounts.\n",
    "   - Example: Using the keyword \"KEY\", the shifts would be based on the positions of 'K', 'E', and 'Y' in the alphabet.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Encryption Process:**\n",
    "   - Choose a keyword.\n",
    "   - Repeat the keyword so it matches the length of the plaintext.\n",
    "   - For each letter in the plaintext, shift it by the corresponding letter in the keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example:**\n",
    "   - Plaintext: ATTACKATDAWN\n",
    "   - Keyword: KEYKEYKEYKEY\n",
    "   - Encryption Steps:\n",
    "     - A (shift by K) -> K\n",
    "     - T (shift by E) -> X\n",
    "     - T (shift by Y) -> R\n",
    "     - A (shift by K) -> K\n",
    "     - C (shift by E) -> G\n",
    "     - K (shift by Y) -> I\n",
    "     - A (shift by K) -> K\n",
    "     - T (shift by E) -> X\n",
    "     - D (shift by Y) -> B\n",
    "     - A (shift by K) -> K\n",
    "     - W (shift by E) -> A\n",
    "     - N (shift by Y) -> L\n",
    "   - Ciphertext: KXRGIKXBKAL\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Decryption Process:**\n",
    "   - To decrypt the message, shift each letter in the ciphertext back by the corresponding letter in the keyword.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     - K (shift by K) -> A\n",
    "     - X (shift by E) -> T\n",
    "     - R (shift by Y) -> T\n",
