                 basic architecture of data base system 
It helps to design, develop, implement, and maintain the database management system. A DBMS architecture allows dividing the database system into individual components that can be independently modified, changed, replaced, and altered
                
                 data base engine
 is the underlying software component that a database management system (DBMS) uses to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) data from a database

                Query Processor
 the process to answer a query to a database or an information system, which usually involves interpreting the query, searching through the space storing data, and retrieving the results satisfying the query
                
                storage manager
 a software layer within a database management system. It relies on operating system primitives for I/O, synchronization, etc. and exposes records in storage structures such as B-trees and heaps

                 Transaction Manager
 ensures that data is restored consistently when the computer restarts after a crash. After a system crash, restoring the data is essential for data recovery. The restoration uses checkpoints, transaction logs, and crash recovery methods
