## Case Study: The Data Breach at Acme Corp

### Background

Acme Corp, a large retail company, experienced a significant data breach last year. Hackers were able to infiltrate the company’s network and steal sensitive information, including customer names, addresses, credit card numbers, and purchase histories. The breach went undetected for several months, and by the time it was discovered, the personal information of millions of customers had been compromised.

### Incident Details

- **Date of Breach:** January 2023
- **Detection Date:** June 2023
- **Data Compromised:** Names, addresses, credit card numbers, purchase histories
- **Number of Affected Customers:** 5 million

### Investigation Findings

- The hackers gained access through a phishing email sent to an employee.
- The company’s network had outdated security software.
- There was a lack of regular security audits and employee training on cybersecurity practices.

## Questions

1. **Understanding the Breach**: What is a data breach, and why is it significant for both the company and its customers?

2. **Methods of Attack**: What is a phishing email, and how can it lead to a data breach?

3. **Security Measures**: What are some basic cybersecurity practices that Acme Corp could have implemented to prevent this breach?

5. **Preventative Actions**: What steps can companies take to detect and respond to data breaches more quickly? How important is employee training in preventing cybersecurity incidents?

## Answers

1.A data breach is when an unauthorized person infiltrates a network and is able to access data that they are not supposed to have access to. It is significant to the company due to there being privacy and security agreements between the company and the end consumers and the company has violated those agreements by way of not securing the data properly as well as fines from the government for bad practice with users' information. It is significant to the customers as comapnies store private and usually sensitive data such as addresses, credit card information, and private medical data which is now available to individuals that are not supposed to access it.

2.A Phising email is an email coming from an attacker usually directed at an individual with high security clearance at a company by pretending to be legitimate colleague or authority that requires attention, and directs the victim to click a link or email which compromises their device and the network by giving the attacker access to their intranet.

3. Acme Corp could have held regular training courses for their employees and increasing the awareness between them of such attacks and how to properly identify such malicious content.

4.The customers could suffer monetary losses as their credit card information was stolen, they could be blackmailed if their purchase histories were incriminating. Acme Corp's reputation has suffered a great hit due to this attack and other corporations and consumers may cease to perform operations with Acme Corp, resulting in reduced revenue and major losses.

5.Companies can introduce regular security checks as well as employing detection software that alerts them when an unauthorized computer accesses their network. Employee training is incredibly important and should be prioritsed due to most network vulnerability points being humans.
