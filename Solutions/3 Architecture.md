# 3 Architecture of Computers Assessment Brief

## Overview

Welcome to your third assessment! This exercise is designed to deepen your understanding of computer components and basic logic gates. You will be asked to pick a computer component and explain its role, inputs, outputs, and interfaces. Additionally, you will solve a logic gate question and provide a complete truth table. This assessment should take about 30 minutes to complete.

This is an open-book assessment, so feel free to refer to any resources you find helpful. It is worth 10% of your final grade.

## Part 1: Computer Component

### Part 1 Instructions

1. **Choose a Component:**
   - Pick a component inside a computer (e.g., GPU, RAM, Hard Drive, Motherboard, Power Supply, etc.), excluding the CPU (as we will use it as an example).

2. **Describe the Component:**
   - Explain the role of the chosen component in the computer system.
   - Describe its inputs and outputs.
   - Identify what other components or systems it interfaces with.

### Answer 

**Component:** Random Access Memory (Ram)

- **Role:** The RAM is a computers short term mamory, Its used to run programs, as when programs are running they need to store information.
- **Inputs:** your computer processor stores data that it needs to run your applications and open your files.
- **Outputs:** it outputs the stored data for your processor.
- **Interfaces:** the memory interface allows the memory controller to perform operations on the data stored.
## Part 2: Logic Gates and Truth Table

### Part 2 Instructions

1. **Logic Gate Question:**
   - Given the following logic gate circuit, describe what it does:
     - A circuit with two inputs (A and B) and an output (Q).
     - The circuit consists of an AND gate followed by a NOT gate.

2. **Truth Table:**
   - Create a truth table for the described logic gate circuit.
   - Include all possible input combinations and the corresponding output.

## Answer
1.
   The (AND) Logic gate only passes as Q as 1 when both A and B are equal to 1, other then that Q will be passed as 0.

2.
   As we can see on the board, the circit consists of an (OR) logic gate followed by a (NOT) logic gate so we can say that whenever A or B are equal to 1 the OR gate will pass 1 but the NOt gate will pass it as a 0, but if both A and B are equal to 0, then the OR gate will pass a 0 and the NOT gate will pass a 1.

   | A | B | OR(A, B) | NOT(OR(A, B)) |
   |---|---|----------|---------------|
   | 0 | 0 |     0    |       1       |
   | 0 | 1 |     1    |       0       |
   | 1 | 0 |     1    |       0       |
   | 1 | 1 |     1    |       0       |
