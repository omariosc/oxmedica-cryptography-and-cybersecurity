# 6 Network Security Concepts Assessment Brief

## Overview

Welcome to your sixth assessment! This exercise is designed to introduce you to network security concepts, including how the internet works, the importance of security, and how security is implemented. This is an open-book assessment worth 15% of your grade and should take about 30 minutes to complete.

This is an open-book assessment, so feel free to refer to any resources you find helpful. It is worth 15% of your final grade.

## Instructions

### Part 1: How the Internet Works (10 minutes)

Write a brief description (150-200 words) of how the internet works. Include key concepts such as IP addresses, DNS, and data packets.

## **Answer**

The internet is a vast network of devices such as computers and servers that communicate with each other using diffrente encription methods and protocols. The internet mostly uses unique IP addresses for devices to idenify one another, and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) to transmit data from one computer to another. whenever a person enters a websitte address into a browser a DNS (Domain Name System) server translates the human-readable address into the servers respective ip address. Once you get the IP address of the w you wnat to access using DNS, your browser sends an HTTP request to the server over port 80 using TCP to extract the HTML webpage corresponding to the IP address. on the internet Data is not sent all at once, its sent one piece at a time in what we call packets. To reach their destination packets have to go through various routes across the network. when they do reach their destination they are then decrypted back into the original message.

### Part 2: Importance of Network Security (10 minutes)

Explain why network security is crucial. Discuss the potential risks and consequences of weak security, including examples of common threats like malware, phishing, and DDoS attacks.

Network security is crucial to protect user private data from malicious intent. There is variety of data sent over the internet range from group chat messages and such which if leak would not cause major harm, to sensitive private data such as bank statements, credit card information, and login credentials which if leaked could cause major financial and reputational damage. This also applies for servers and websites that with insufficient security can be vulnerable to attacks such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, and data breaches. for example a malware attack can expose personal information, leading to identity theft, or gain private data from a company leading to lost revenue and customer trust, and DDoS attacks can shut down an organization's online services, and entire social networks.

### Part 3: Implementing Network Security (10 minutes)

Describe how network security can be implemented. Include at least three methods such as firewalls, encryption, and secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS).

Firewalls: Act as a Barrier to all incoming and outgoing network traffic monitoring and controlling them to make sure their scure and trusted.
Encryption: Its a way of protecting Data sent over the internet by converting it into a code that can only be deciphered with a key, this ensures that the data will be safe even if intersecpted.
Secure protocols: Protocols like HTTPS or TCP make sure that communication between the client and server is encrypted, which ensures that the data will be safe even if intersecpted.


<!-- ### Example Implementation

Network security can be implemented through various methods:

- **Firewalls:** Act as barriers between trusted and untrusted networks, monitoring and controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
- **Encryption:** Protects data by converting it into a code that can only be deciphered with a key, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential during transmission.
- **Secure Protocols:** Protocols like HTTPS ensure secure communication over the internet by encrypting data between the client and server, preventing interception and tampering. -->
