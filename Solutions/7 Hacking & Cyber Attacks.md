# 7 Hacking and Cyber Attacks Assessment Brief

## Overview

Welcome to your seventh assessment! This mid-term test will assess your understanding of different types of cyber attacks and potential mitigations. This is an open-book assessment worth 20% of your grade and should take about 30 minutes to complete.

This is an open-book assessment, so feel free to refer to any resources you find helpful. It is worth 20% of your final grade.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Types of Cyber Attacks (15 minutes)

1. **Describe Different Attacks:**
   - Write a brief description of each of the following types of cyber attacks. Include examples where possible.
     - **Phishing:**
     - **Malware:**
     - **Ransomware:**
     - **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service):**
     - **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):**


## **Answer** 

Phishing: It's a type of attack that targets users trust on email that claim to be from source sites, It consists of either a fake website to steal login information or a malicious link to install malware on the device, an example of this would be if an employee in a banking company got an email from a trusted source with a link , when they click the link it instals malware on the computer then infects the entire network to access private data.

Malware: Malicious software designed to harm, and access a computer or network, in the hopes of stealing data or gaining unauthorised access. There are a number of types including worms, trojans, viruses, spyware, Adware, Ransomware.

Ransomware: It's a type of Malicious software designed to encrypt and block the users files on their device holding it ransom for money often in the form of cryptocurrency, an example of this would be if you were to click on a popup ad and it would download a malware on your computer and it would display a message such as "Your files are ours, pay us and you can have them back. send the money to this wallet (insert_crypto_wallet)".

DDos (Distributed Denial of Service):It's an attack designed to overwhelm a website by sending a large number of requests to the server, this often results in the website or online service becoming slow and unusable.

Man-in-the-Middle (MitM): It's an attack designed to intercept data transmission and steal the information it was sending, for example an attacker can intercept and read the messages between two parties without their knowledge.

### Part 2: Mitigations (15 minutes)

1. **Potential Mitigations:**
   - For each type of attack described in Part 1, suggest one or more potential mitigations. Explain how these mitigations can help prevent or reduce the impact of the attacks.


Phishing: Implementing training programs for employees to help educate them on the dangers of Phishing emails and how to recognize them, or using a filter to detect and block phishing emails


Malware: by using anti-virus services to scan your files to make sure there is no malicious software hidden in them. also Educate users about how to recognize suspicious messages and fake download ads and not download software from untrusted sources.


Ransomware: Make backups of your files so that even if you are victim to this it won't be too much of a problem. and keep systems and software up to date with the latest security patches. Educate users on how to spot suspicious links and emails.


DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service): implementing protocols and service to detect and limit the impact of DDos attacks. use services to distribute traffic across multiple servers.
and ensure that your servers can handle the impact of these attacks so as to not have your services shut down.


Man-in-the-Middle (MitM): this can be countered by using encryption to make sure communication channels are secure. and use VPNs to protect your data while its transmitting.
