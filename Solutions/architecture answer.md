part picked: hard drive

explaining the role of a hard drive:
a hard drive is a data storage device used in computers to store and retrieve data permanently even when the computer is turned off, it stores the operating system, software, and user data. it plays an important role as it dictates the speed of data access which affects the overall user experience.

hard drive inputs and outputs:

inputs: it connects to power from the psu, and recieves data from the cpu and ram via the motherboard.

outputs: data output to the cpu or ram, and has lights on the actual drive to indicate status of operation.

how a hard drive interfaces with other hardware:
the hard drive interfaces with the motherboard through SATA and NVME connectors for data transfer. the motherboard acts like a hub between the hdd, cpu, and ram. the hard drive also connects with the cpu, with the cpu sending read and write commands to the hdd, while also processing data recieved from the hdd and executing instructions. the ram also connects to the hdd because data from the hdd is often temporarily moved to the ram for faster access by the cpu, and they both work together to manage data storage and retrieval efficiently. the hard drive also recieves power from the psu. 

logic gate excercise:
first logic gate is an or gate, second logic gate is a not gate, the or gate outputs a 1 if either input is positive, a not gate simply reverses the input given to it. so the resulting output will be opposite the regular "or" truth table.

if A and B are inputs, and both are 0, the output is 1
if A is 0 and B is 1, the output is 0
if A is 1 and B is 0, the output is 0
if A and B are 1, the output is 0
